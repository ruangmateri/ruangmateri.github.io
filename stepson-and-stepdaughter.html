                                            The story of Nyi Roro Kidul originated from a beautiful-looking princess named Kadita. Because of her charming beauty, she was also called Dewi Srengenge (the beautiful sun). Kadita's father was a king named Munding Wangi. However, having a beautiful daughter like Kadita did not make Munding Wangi happy. The reason was that he did not want to have a daughter. Munding Wangi then married again with Dewi Mutiara and was blessed with a son. Immediately, the birth of a son made him very happy. Although Mundi Wangi had a son as he wished, his love for Kadita still would not fade.On the other hand, Dewi Mutiara hoped her son could become a king. She would do anything to realize his desire. She even expelled Kadita, her stepdaughter, out of the kingdom that made King Munding Wangi furious. Of course, the Munding Wangi King would not let anyone hurt his beautiful daughter.However, Dewi Mutiara did not lose sense and kept trying to expel Kadita.The next day, Dewi Mutiara sent a shaman to curse Kadita into full of scabies on her body.When Kadita awoke, she realized that her whole body was stinking and made her cry hysterically.Hearing the news, the king was very upset and sad. He then called a doctor to cure Kadita's disease.Unfortunately, it did not work. The king then realized that her daughter's disease was not natural. Finally, he sent Kadita out of the kingdom and avoided gossip in all countries.On her trip for seven days and seven nights, Kadita arrived in the Southern Ocean. She looked at the clear and clean sea. After that, Kadita tried to jump and swim in the ocean. Miraculously, when her body was exposed to ocean water, her disease little by little faded and she became beautiful again, even more beautiful than ever. Furthermore, Kadita now had power over the South Ocean and was called Nyi Roro Kidul or the Queen of the Southern Sea.As the Queen of the Southern Sea, the existence of Nyi Roro Kidul is still highly respected by the local community and has become part of the culture. Some people who do not believe this legend say that the myth was deliberately created to strengthen the legitimacy of ancient kings. However, there are even some places that supposedly become the real world link with Nyi Rorol Kidul.King Munding Wangi was still unhappy although he had a very beautiful daughter because ….A. He wanted to have a sonB. His daughter didn’t smell goodC. His daughter had a black magicD. He wanted to have a lot of wivesE. His daughter was loved by too many people​</a>

                                            BAWANG Putih lived with her step mother and her step sister, Bawang Merah. Bawang Putih's mother died when she was a baby. Her father remarried another woman and later her step sister was born. Unfortunately, not long after that her father died. Since then, Bawang Putih's life was sad. Her step mother and her step sister treated Bawang Putih badly and always asked her to do all the household chores.
One morning, Bawang Putih was washing some clothes in a river. Accidentally, her mother's clothes were washed away by the river. She was really worried so she walked along the river side to find the clothes. Finally she met an old woman. She said that she kept the clothes and would give them back to Bawang Putih if she helped the old woman do the household chores. Bawang Putih helped her happily. After everything was finished, the old woman returned the clothes. She also gave Bawang Putih a gift. The old woman had two pumpkins, one pumpkin was small and the other one was big. Bawang Putih had to choose one.
Bawang Putih was not a greedy girl. So she took the small one. After thanking the old woman, Bawang Putih then went home. When she arrived home, her step mother and Bawang Merah were angry. They had been waiting for her all day long. Bawang Putih then told about the clothes, the old woman, and the pumpkin. Her mother was really angry so she grabbed the pumpkin and smashed it to the floor. Suddenly they all were surprised. Inside the pumpkin they found jewelries. "Bawang Merah, hurry up. Go to the river and throw my clothes into the water. After that, find the old woman. Remember, you have to take the big pumpkin," the step mother asked Bawang Merah to do exactly the same as Bawang Putih's experience. Bawang Merah immediately went to the river. She threw the clothes and pretended to search them. Not long after that, she met the old woman. Again she asked Bawang Merah to do household chores. She refused and asked the old woman to give her a big pumpkin. The old woman then gave her the big one. Bawang Merah was so happy. She ran very fast. When she arrived home, her mother was impatient. She directly smashed the pumpkin to the floor. They were screaming. There were a lot of snakes inside the pumpkin! They were really scared. They were afraid the snakes would bite them. "Mom, I think God just punished us. We had done bad things to Bawang Putih. And God didn't like that. We have to apologize to Bawang Putih," said Bawang Merah.
Finally both of them realized their mistakes. They apologized and Bawang Putih forgave them. Now the family is not poor anymore. Bawang Putih decided to sell all the jewelries and used the money for their daily lives.

                                            The story of Nyi Roro Kidul originated from a beautiful-looking princess named Kadita. Because of her charming beauty, she was also called Dewi Srengenge (the beautiful sun). Kadita's father was a king named Munding Wangi. However, having a beautiful daughter like Kadita did not make Munding Wangi happy. The reason was that he did not want to have a daughter. Munding Wangi then married again with Dewi Mutiara and was blessed with a son. Immediately, the birth of a son made him very happy. Although Mundi Wangi had a son as he wished, his love for Kadita still would not fade.On the other hand, Dewi Mutiara hoped her son could become a king. She would do anything to realize his desire. She even expelled Kadita, her stepdaughter, out of the kingdom that made King Munding Wangi furious. Of course, the Munding Wangi King would not let anyone hurt his beautiful daughter.However, Dewi Mutiara did not lose sense and kept trying to expel Kadita.The next day, Dewi Mutiara sent a shaman to curse Kadita into full of scabies on her body.When Kadita awoke, she realized that her whole body was stinking and made her cry hysterically.Hearing the news, the king was very upset and sad. He then called a doctor to cure Kadita's disease.Unfortunately, it did not work. The king then realized that her daughter's disease was not natural. Finally, he sent Kadita out of the kingdom and avoided gossip in all countries.On her trip for seven days and seven nights, Kadita arrived in the Southern Ocean. She looked at the clear and clean sea. After that, Kadita tried to jump and swim in the ocean. Miraculously, when her body was exposed to ocean water, her disease little by little faded and she became beautiful again, even more beautiful than ever. Furthermore, Kadita now had power over the South Ocean and was called Nyi Roro Kidul or the Queen of the Southern Sea.As the Queen of the Southern Sea, the existence of Nyi Roro Kidul is still highly respected by the local community and has become part of the culture. Some people who do not believe this legend say that the myth was deliberately created to strengthen the legitimacy of ancient kings. However, there are even some places that supposedly become the real world link with Nyi Rorol Kidul.The traits of Dewi Mutiara are ….A. Curious and powerfulB. Wicked and lazyC. Calm and impoliteD. Rebellious and generousE. Mean and highly-determined​</a>

She made the stepdaughter do all the hardest work in the house, and the girl obeyed her without complaint. One day, the stepmother sent her out to the well to get water, and there she met an old woman who asked her for a drink. The kind young girl served the old woman as if she were a queen, In truth that old woman was a fairy in disguise, and she was so moved by the young girl’s kindness that she rewarded her with an extraordinary gift, every time she spoke, from her lips, along with the words, fell flowers and diamonds. The stepmother was furious when she heard what had happened to her stepdaughter. Immediately she sent her own daughter to the well, so that she could come back with the same gift. This time, the fairy appeared in the form of queen. But when she asked for a drink, the young woman said rudely,’ if you want a drink, get it yourself.’ ‘You are most unkind,’said the fairy,’and for that i will give you a very different reward’.

                            7. The story of Nyi Roro Kidul originated from a beautiful-looking princess named Kadita. Because of her charming beauty, she was also called Dewi Srengenge (the beautiful sun). Kadita's father was a king named Munding Wangi. However, having a beautiful daughter like Kadita did not make Munding Wangi happy. The reason was that he did not want to have a daughter. Munding Wangi then married again with Dewi Mutiara and was blessed with a son. Immediately, the birth of a son made him very happy. Although Mundi Wangi had a son as he wished, his love for Kadita still would not fade.On the other hand, Dewi Mutiara hoped her son could become a king. She would do anything to realize his desire. She even expelled Kadita, her stepdaughter, out of the kingdom that made King Munding Wangi furious. Of course, the Munding Wangi King would not let anyone hurt his beautiful daughter.However, Dewi Mutiara did not lose sense and kept trying to expel Kadita.The next day, Dewi Mutiara sent a shaman to curse Kadita into full of scabies on her body.When Kadita awoke, she realized that her whole body was stinking and made her cry hysterically.Hearing the news, the king was very upset and sad. He then called a doctor to cure Kadita's disease.Unfortunately, it did not work. The king then realized that her daughter's disease was not natural. Finally, he sent Kadita out of the kingdom and avoided gossip in all countries.On her trip for seven days and seven nights, Kadita arrived in the Southern Ocean. She looked at the clear and clean sea. After that, Kadita tried to jump and swim in the ocean. Miraculously, when her body was exposed to ocean water, her disease little by little faded and she became beautiful again, even more beautiful than ever. Furthermore, Kadita now had power over the South Ocean and was called Nyi Roro Kidul or the Queen of the Southern Sea.As the Queen of the Southern Sea, the existence of Nyi Roro Kidul is still highly respected by the local community and has become part of the culture. Some people who do not believe this legend say that the myth was deliberately created to strengthen the legitimacy of ancient kings. However, there are even some places that supposedly become the real world link with Nyi Rorol Kidul.King Munding Wangi was still unhappy although he had a very beautiful daughter because ….A.

                            9. BAWANG Putih lived with her step mother and her step sister, Bawang Merah. Bawang Putih's mother died when she was a baby. Her father remarried another woman and later her step sister was born. Unfortunately, not long after that her father died. Since then, Bawang Putih's life was sad. Her step mother and her step sister treated Bawang Putih badly and always asked her to do all the household chores.
One morning, Bawang Putih was washing some clothes in a river. Accidentally, her mother's clothes were washed away by the river. She was really worried so she walked along the river side to find the clothes. Finally she met an old woman. She said that she kept the clothes and would give them back to Bawang Putih if she helped the old woman do the household chores. Bawang Putih helped her happily. After everything was finished, the old woman returned the clothes. She also gave Bawang Putih a gift. The old woman had two pumpkins, one pumpkin was small and the other one was big. Bawang Putih had to choose one.
Bawang Putih was not a greedy girl. So she took the small one. After thanking the old woman, Bawang Putih then went home. When she arrived home, her step mother and Bawang Merah were angry. They had been waiting for her all day long. Bawang Putih then told about the clothes, the old woman, and the pumpkin. Her mother was really angry so she grabbed the pumpkin and smashed it to the floor. Suddenly they all were surprised. Inside the pumpkin they found jewelries. "Bawang Merah, hurry up. Go to the river and throw my clothes into the water. After that, find the old woman. Remember, you have to take the big pumpkin," the step mother asked Bawang Merah to do exactly the same as Bawang Putih's experience. Bawang Merah immediately went to the river. She threw the clothes and pretended to search them. Not long after that, she met the old woman. Again she asked Bawang Merah to do household chores. She refused and asked the old woman to give her a big pumpkin. The old woman then gave her the big one. Bawang Merah was so happy. She ran very fast. When she arrived home, her mother was impatient. She directly smashed the pumpkin to the floor. They were screaming. There were a lot of snakes inside the pumpkin! They were really scared. They were afraid the snakes would bite them. "Mom, I think God just punished us. We had done bad things to Bawang Putih. And God didn't like that. We have to apologize to Bawang Putih," said Bawang Merah.
Finally both of them realized their mistakes. They apologized and Bawang Putih forgave them. Now the family is not poor anymore. Bawang Putih decided to sell all the jewelries and used the money for their daily lives.

Because of her charming beauty, she was also called Dewi Srengenge (the beautiful sun). Kadita's father was a king named Munding Wangi. However, having a beautiful daughter like Kadita did not make Munding Wangi happy. The reason was that he did not want to have a daughter. Munding Wangi then married again with Dewi Mutiara and was blessed with a son. Immediately, the birth of a son made him very happy. Although Mundi Wangi had a son as he wished, his love for Kadita still would not fade.On the other hand, Dewi Mutiara hoped her son could become a king. She would do anything to realize his desire. She even expelled Kadita, her stepdaughter, out of the kingdom that made King Munding Wangi furious. Of course, the Munding Wangi King would not let anyone hurt his beautiful daughter.However, Dewi Mutiara did not lose sense and kept trying to expel Kadita.The next day, Dewi Mutiara sent a shaman to curse Kadita into full of scabies on her body.When Kadita awoke, she realized that her whole body was stinking and made her cry hysterically.Hearing the news, the king was very upset and sad. He then called a doctor to cure Kadita's disease.Unfortunately, it did not work. The king then realized that her daughter's disease was not natural. Finally, he sent Kadita out of the kingdom and avoided gossip in all countries.On her trip for seven days and seven nights, Kadita arrived in the Southern Ocean. She looked at the clear and clean sea. After that, Kadita tried to jump and swim in the ocean. Miraculously, when her body was exposed to ocean water, her disease little by little faded and she became beautiful again, even more beautiful than ever. Furthermore, Kadita now had power over the South Ocean and was called Nyi Roro Kidul or the Queen of the Southern Sea.As the Queen of the Southern Sea, the existence of Nyi Roro Kidul is still highly respected by the local community and has become part of the culture. Some people who do not believe this legend say that the myth was deliberately created to strengthen the legitimacy of ancient kings. However, there are even some places that supposedly become the real world link with Nyi Rorol Kidul.The traits of Dewi Mutiara are ….A. Curious and powerfulB. Wicked and lazyC. Calm and impoliteD. Rebellious and generousE. Mean and highly-determined​</h2><br />
