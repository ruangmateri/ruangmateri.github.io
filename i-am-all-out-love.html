My skin was black,  my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the mountain
I am   insecure and afraid
My eyes are small, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from overweight to teen 
My skin is inked, but faded, too
My brain was tired, but my heart isn't
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why did you love me?
Cause I don't even love myself
Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and broke it too
And I was never late, always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothing 
My heart was tired
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah
He loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself
Cause, baby, the best part of me is you

Baby, I'm so in love with you

-
For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you</a>

Jimmy Harnen - Where Are You Now
All alone tonight I'm calling out your name
Somewhere deep inside this part of you remains
Images of love take me back in time
I don't know how it started
Or why it ever had to end
Something stepped inside
We didn't let it in
It's keeping us apart
Where are you now
Where are you now
Is someone there tonight
Holding what was mine
Where are you now
You wonder where I am
Are you really feeling fine
Going through my life without you by my side
You're the only thing that keeps going through my mind
And nothing that I do can take the place of you
Where are you now
Is someone there tonight holding what was mine
Where are you now, do you wonder where I am
Are you really feeling fine
Ooh thinking about you girl
There's gotta be a place for me
Somewhere in your heart
All alone tonight I'm calling out your name
Somewhere deep inside this part of you remains
Images of love and where are you now
Where are you now
Is someone there tonight holding what was mine
Where are you now
You wonder where I am, I need you here tonight.</a>

If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.
And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.
If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you.
And when the world was through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
Then you and I would simply fly away</a>

                                            This Is Me by Keala Settle 
I am not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one'll love you as you are
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me
Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun
(We are the warriors)
Yeah, that’s what we’ve become.

-
For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you</a>

                                            Dear All,At last, we are at the end of our academic year. I know the last few months haven’t been easy at all. We have been forced to do lots of activities so much different from what we did previously.Remember the time when the situation made us stay in instead of going out. We have experienced about “social distancing” as a strategy to fight COVID-19 as well as to protect ourselves. Also, we have been cancelling meeting appointments, hanging out activities, and even planned trips. I believe things have been tough for all of us.Now, you are facing final exams, you have been studying independently, you have been convincing yourselves that you could study from home, manage your time, try to understand lessons and do your assignments physically away from fellow students and teachers . So far, you survive. You are incredible!My wish for you is that you see the light in this world, in yourself, and in others. I see the light in you. Compliment others, and be proud of your own accomplishments. I am proud of you. Believe in yourself, for you are stronger than you know. I believe in you. Try hard, but know your limits. Ask if you need help, and trust others will help you. I will help you. Fill your heart with laughter and smile often. I love to see your smile. You are a unique, special, and amazing person. There will never be another you. I appreciate all of you.Dream, believe, wonder, inspire, love, nurture, and always listen. That is what I will do for you.Love,Your Biggest Supporter​</a>

 I know that I a m running out of time 
I want it all
And I am wishing they “d stop tryna turn me off.
I want it on
And I am walking on a wire
Trying to go higher
Feel s like I am surrounded 
By clown and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all
We came here to run it, run it , run it
We came here to run it , run it
Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day 
Watch this madness , colorful charade 
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I will be flying free
I am disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling , What you gonna say ?
Just like fire

I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man I had a master plan
But I was alone
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone
1-And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Always end up alone, always end up alone
So I'll play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time
Living love betwen the line
We came (sha la) so close (so far)
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mi-i-ine, and I don't wanna be alone
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone
And is there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la
And I pray it's not too late
We came sha la so far so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine
And I don't wanna be alone
(repeat 1...)
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
I don't wanna be alone face the heat of the the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
You search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight I'm caught in the rain
And there's no one home</a>

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I’ll be forever thankful, baby
You’re the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You’re the one who saw me through
Through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn’t speak
You were my eyes when I couldn’t see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn’t reach
You gave me faith ’cause you believed
I’m everything I am
Because you loved me, ooh, baby
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I’m grateful for each day you gave me</a>

                                            the story tells us about?Once upon a time, in an island there lived all the feelings and emotions : Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day it was announced to them that the island would sink! So all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.  Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.  When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.  Richness was passing by Love in a boat. Love said,  "Richness, can you take me with you?" Richness answered, "Sorry Love, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat and so there is no place here for you."  Love next asked Vanity who was also sailing by. Vanity was also ready with the same answer.   "I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered.  Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, take me along with you." "Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!", sadness said in a sullen voice.  Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so preoccupied with her happiness that she did not even hear when Love called her.   Suddenly, there was a voice, "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. An overjoyed Love jumped up into the boat and in the process forgot to ask where they were going. When they arrived at a dry land, the elder went her own way.   Realizing how much was owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge another elder, "Who Helped me?" "It was Time," Knowledge answered. "Time?" thought Love. Then, as if reading the face of Love, Knowledge smiled and answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is." </a>

Now that I am a mother, I'm realizing just what you went through with me. You were always so patient and kind even when you had to sacrifice what you were doing to help me. I admire your intelligence. I know you gave up your dreams of being a pharmacist when I came along I can't imagine all the dreams you actually gave up just for me and because of me, but I am glad you are my momWhenever I had faced hard times in school, you were there to encourage me. Learning how to make friends, dealing with hurts, feeling alone, and learning how to navigate through the craziness of growing up-I knew I could turn to you for answersWhat I appreciate is that you wouldn't just see what I went through and just tell me what to doThe point is that you would actually take time out of your day to listen to me and my problems. I do that with my daughter now, and I realize how much I love doing this.Thank you for your example to me. Again, I love you and Happy Mother's Day.Lots of love,Seo Ye Ji​</a>

My skin was black,  my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the mountain
I am   insecure and afraid
My eyes are small, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from overweight to teen 
My skin is inked, but faded, too
My brain was tired, but my heart isn't
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why did you love me?
Cause I don't even love myself
Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and broke it too
And I was never late, always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothing 
My heart was tired
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah
He loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

-
For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p><p>a. Because she feels confident enough</p><p><strong>Explanation :</strong></p><p>In the context of the song "This Is Me" by Keala Settle, the line "Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in" means that the singer is determined to not let the hurtful words and actions of others affect her self-worth and confidence. She chooses to rise above the negativity and embrace her true self, scars and all. So, the singer is not actually letting people physically fire at her, but rather she is using the metaphor of bullets to represent hurtful words and criticism.</p><p></p><br />

Jimmy Harnen - Where Are You Now
All alone tonight I'm calling out your name
Somewhere deep inside this part of you remains
Images of love take me back in time
I don't know how it started
Or why it ever had to end
Something stepped inside
We didn't let it in
It's keeping us apart
Where are you now
Where are you now
Is someone there tonight
Holding what was mine
Where are you now
You wonder where I am
Are you really feeling fine
Going through my life without you by my side
You're the only thing that keeps going through my mind
And nothing that I do can take the place of you
Where are you now
Is someone there tonight holding what was mine
Where are you now, do you wonder where I am
Are you really feeling fine
Ooh thinking about you girl
There's gotta be a place for me
Somewhere in your heart
All alone tonight I'm calling out your name
Somewhere deep inside this part of you remains
Images of love and where are you now
Where are you now
Is someone there tonight holding what was mine
Where are you now
You wonder where I am, I need you here tonight.</h2><br />

                            19. This Is Me by Keala Settle 
I am not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one'll love you as you are
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me
Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun
(We are the warriors)
Yeah, that’s what we’ve become.

For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby

You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you</h2><br />

                            24. Dear All,At last, we are at the end of our academic year. I know the last few months haven’t been easy at all. We have been forced to do lots of activities so much different from what we did previously.Remember the time when the situation made us stay in instead of going out. We have experienced about “social distancing” as a strategy to fight COVID-19 as well as to protect ourselves. Also, we have been cancelling meeting appointments, hanging out activities, and even planned trips. I believe things have been tough for all of us.Now, you are facing final exams, you have been studying independently, you have been convincing yourselves that you could study from home, manage your time, try to understand lessons and do your assignments physically away from fellow students and teachers . So far, you survive. You are incredible!My wish for you is that you see the light in this world, in yourself, and in others. I see the light in you. Compliment others, and be proud of your own accomplishments. I am proud of you. Believe in yourself, for you are stronger than you know. I believe in you. Try hard, but know your limits. Ask if you need help, and trust others will help you. I will help you. Fill your heart with laughter and smile often. I love to see your smile. You are a unique, special, and amazing person. There will never be another you. I appreciate all of you.Dream, believe, wonder, inspire, love, nurture, and always listen. That is what I will do for you.Love,Your Biggest Supporter​</h2><br />

                            25. english song:
 I know that I a m running out of time 
I want it all
And I am wishing they “d stop tryna turn me off.
I want it on
And I am walking on a wire
Trying to go higher
Feel s like I am surrounded 
By clown and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all
We came here to run it, run it , run it
We came here to run it , run it
Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day 
Watch this madness , colorful charade 
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I will be flying free
I am disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling , What you gonna say ?
Just like fire

I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man I had a master plan
But I was alone
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone
1-And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Always end up alone, always end up alone
So I'll play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time
Living love betwen the line
We came (sha la) so close (so far)
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mi-i-ine, and I don't wanna be alone
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone
And is there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la
And I pray it's not too late
We came sha la so far so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine
And I don't wanna be alone
(repeat 1...)
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
I don't wanna be alone face the heat of the the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
You search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight I'm caught in the rain
And there's no one home</h2><br />

I’ll be forever thankful, baby
You’re the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You’re the one who saw me through
Through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn’t speak
You were my eyes when I couldn’t see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn’t reach
You gave me faith ’cause you believed
I’m everything I am
Because you loved me, ooh, baby
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I’m grateful for each day you gave me</h2><br />

                            35. the story tells us about?Once upon a time, in an island there lived all the feelings and emotions : Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day it was announced to them that the island would sink! So all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.  Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.  When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.  Richness was passing by Love in a boat. Love said,  "Richness, can you take me with you?" Richness answered, "Sorry Love, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat and so there is no place here for you."  Love next asked Vanity who was also sailing by. Vanity was also ready with the same answer.   "I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered.  Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, take me along with you." "Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!", sadness said in a sullen voice.  Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so preoccupied with her happiness that she did not even hear when Love called her.   Suddenly, there was a voice, "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. An overjoyed Love jumped up into the boat and in the process forgot to ask where they were going. When they arrived at a dry land, the elder went her own way.   Realizing how much was owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge another elder, "Who Helped me?" "It was Time," Knowledge answered. "Time?" thought Love. Then, as if reading the face of Love, Knowledge smiled and answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is." </h2><br />

You were always so patient and kind even when you had to sacrifice what you were doing to help me. I admire your intelligence. I know you gave up your dreams of being a pharmacist when I came along I can't imagine all the dreams you actually gave up just for me and because of me, but I am glad you are my momWhenever I had faced hard times in school, you were there to encourage me. Learning how to make friends, dealing with hurts, feeling alone, and learning how to navigate through the craziness of growing up-I knew I could turn to you for answersWhat I appreciate is that you wouldn't just see what I went through and just tell me what to doThe point is that you would actually take time out of your day to listen to me and my problems. I do that with my daughter now, and I realize how much I love doing this.Thank you for your example to me. Again, I love you and Happy Mother's Day.Lots of love,Seo Ye Ji​</h2><br />
