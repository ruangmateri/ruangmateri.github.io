It is very useful because it helps people clean dishes and eating-utensils. In 1887 Josephine Cochrane invented the first dishwasher. She made the machine because her servants often broke her lovely ceramic dishes. Since then dishwashers have continuously improved until today. Modern dishwashers are made of stainless steel and consists of a front drawing-door for loading dishes, a wire rack for the dirty crockery, a rotating sprayer and a drying element. The standard width and depth is 60 cm or 24 inches in Europe and in the US. Dishwashers clean the dirt from the dishes by spraying hot water, typically between 550 and 75° C. The water is mixed with detergent. Then the mixture is pumped by rotating spray arms which spray it onto the dishes. When the washing processes finishes, the water is drained and more hot water is pumped in for a rinsing process. The final process is to heat the dishes to dry them. The whole process needs 15 to 20 minutes 4. A text that provides information about something is called?A. ReportB. Description C. Historical RecountD. Procedure​</h2><br />
