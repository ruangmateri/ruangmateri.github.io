I must say, I really envy you getting that Tokyo gig with the company. Somehow they overlooked me on that one and I am forced to slug it out here through another frigid and snowy Montreal winter. Brrr! I heard through the grapevine that business is going well there. Rumor has it that you guys are just about to close a big deal with the Japanese government for an M-750 Simulator. Great news! Good for the company and good for you. Keep up the great work! I am quite busy these days on the Branscombe Systems project. We are entering Phase Two now, and that is expected to run for three years, at least. Frank Schinddler is Senior project Manager and I am Team Leader of the Embedded Systems group. I am enjoying it so far. Whether I'll feel the same way in three years, I'm not sure. By then I might be ready to join you in Japan. I'm still kicking butt in the squash court and am managing to get two or three matches per week. What about squash in Japan? Have you been able to play any over there? Are there even squash courts? I suppose since you are in Tokyo there must be some. Let me know. I have to go now and attend to family duties. Jonathan needs some help with his homework and Angie wants me to fix something in the kitchen. You single guys traveling the world sure are lucky! Keep me posted whenever you can.

My reasons for this belief are that these phones are convenient for business people who travel a lot, and they are handy for emergencies. To begin with, mobile phones are necessary in the case of emergencies. For instance, if you fall down a set of stairs in a building and are badly injured and can't reach a pay phone, it is handy to have one to use. Or, if your car breaks down in the middle of the night in a strange neighborhood, it would be dangerous to leave it in search of a public phone booth. My other main reason is that mobile phones are convenient for business people. For example, if you are out of the state or even overseas and you have to contact a client to do some important work, it is useful to have one to use. By using a mobile phone, important information can be received. People can't stay in an office all day waiting for their phone to ring. Some people have to go and do jobs or they will go out of business. You can even send faxes or messages and use the internet with your mobile. In conclusion, I believe that mobile phones have now become a necessary part of everyday life. Instant communication will ensure that information can be passed on with a simple press of a button. Whether this is to do with business or personal information or emergencies, it goes to show that they are necessary in the new millennium. 26. What is the best tittle text above? 27.

That very night, the donkey crept out of the stable and into the house where the farmer sat at supper. "First I'll frisk about and chase my tail, just as the dog does," thought the donkey. And he danced about the room, flinging up his hooves until the table toppled over and dishes went flying.
"Now I'll sit on his lap!" said the donkey, and he put his hooves up on the master's chair.
"Help! Save me from this mad beast!" the terrified farmer bellowed. Then his servants came running and, with shouts and blows, drove the donkey back to the stable.
"I suppose I' m a fine donkey, "the donkey lamented," but I'll never be a lapdog!"

                                            2. What is the tone of this poem by Philip Henry Savage? Even in the city, I Am ever conscious of the sky; A portion of its frame no less Than in the open wilderness. The stars are in my heart by night, I sing beneath the opening light, As envious of the bird; I live Upon the payment, yet I give My soul to every growing tree That in the narrow ways I see. My heart is in the blade of grass Within the courtyard where I pass; And the small, half-discovered cloud Compels me till I cry aloud. I am the wind that beats the walls And wander trembling till it falls; The snow, the summer rain am I, In close communion with the sky. Pilih jawaban: Objective Sarcastic Neutral Subjective Formal 3.

Rose sat all alone in the big best parlor, with her little handkerchief laid ready to catch the first tear, for she was thinking of her troubles, and a shower was expected. She had retired to this room as a good place in which to be miserable; for it was dark and still, full of ancient furniture, sombre curtains, and hung all around with portraits of solemn old gentlemen in wigs, severe-nosed ladies in top-heavy caps, and staring children in little bob-tailed coats or short-waisted frocks. It was an excellent place for woe; and the fitful spring rain that pattered on the window-pane seemed to sob, "Cry away: I'm with you." Pilih jawaban: Neutral Bored Sad Happy Angry 4.

They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, an sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins. "This must be the Land of Oz," said Dorothy, "and we are surely getting near the Emerald City." "Yes," answered the Scarecrow.

Hundreds of years ago the Dayak tribe known as one of the most powerful tribes in the world. The tribe lives side by side with their beloved nature peacefully.
This condition has made most of the Dayak men grow as the son of the jungle and well known as the best hunters ever.
There was one animal that cannot be tranquil live side by side. The animal was the crocodile.
One day, a Dayak man who was a good hunter went to the jungle to hunt some animals that can be a cook for his family as a dinner.
The sky was getting dark when he returned home carrying four jungle fowls.
At the end of the forest, near a big river, he startled to see a large crocodile on the path in front of him. The crocodile was staring at him in a strange way.
The man who was aware of the cruelness and bad temper of the crocodile. He tried to avoid the dangerous situation by starting a friendly conversation.
"Where are you going, Mr. Crocodile?" he asked.
"I m looking for some food and was starting swimming up. But then, as I saw you my spirit rose again." said the satirist crocodile.
"Well, why don't you come home with me? I am sure my wife will be happy to cook something for you. Or we can cook these two jungle fowls and have dinner together."
The Dayak thought it was the best way for him to answer the crocodile. He was afraid that if he did not treat the crocodile politely. The crocodile would be angry and tried to eat him up in a tricky way.
"Thank you," replied the crocodile.
"It was an exciting invitation." He was curious to see how the Dayaks lived as had never visited one of their houses before.
Besides, the man was friendly and could talk to him well. It would be an excellent chance for him. An opportunity to live with the Dayak tribe.
The crocodile eats the meal from Mrs. Dayak had cooked for him.
Then the crocodile said, "I feel welcome and comfortable here. Can I stay with you any longer?"
"Oh, of course," the Dayak said.
He thought that it would make him became a talented man because a crocodile was staying at his house.
"Why don't you allow him to marry our daughter?" his wife asked one day.
"You must be out of your mind!" her husband cried.
"Well, is there something wrong with my idea? Have you never heard the old Dayak story about the crocodile that married a girl? They will change into a handsome and rich young man?"
"I don't believe in fairy stories," Her husband said.
"In real life, it would be possible if you do not like creature like a crocodile to marry a young girl."
"All right," she answered.
"Even if he's not a handsome, wealthy, young man, he will have to work to support you. That's the Dayak custom, don't you remember?"
Finally, the man agreed with his wife's idea. He allowed the crocodile to marry his daughter. He the hope that the crocodile will always support his family.
As the time has gone by, the man soon found out that his son-in-law was lazy and good for nothing. The crocodile only wanted to lie in the sun all day long and show his sharp teeth from time to time.
He refused to do any work. He would not even catch fish for his wife. One day, his father-in-law's supply of rice was lacking. Mr. Dayak tried to force the crocodile to work in the rice field.
The crocodile refused to do the job. The crocodile threatened Mr. Dayak to give him more food. The crocodile opens his tribe-looking mouth and showing his sharp teeth.
The news of this condition spread to the other villagers. All the villagers soon hated the crocodile.
"What must we do?" they asked each other.
"If we keep quite, all the crocodiles will think that we're afraid of them. We must find a solution to teach the crocodile a good lesson."
Thus one day, while he was sleeping, they jumped on him. They cut into pieces.
The news of what had happened quickly reached the king of the crocodiles. Surprisingly enough, he agreed with what the Dayaks had done.
"Customs are important," he whispered.
"They must always to follow. As he married a Dayak girl, he should have followed the Dayaks customs. He deserved what he got.".
So to this day, a crocodile will not dare to look Dayak in the face or do any harm to him.</a>

                                            “My Rainforest Adventure”Today I woke up at 5:00a in the morning. I put on my loose fitting shirt, trousers, sturdy black boots with little holes in them, wide brimmed hat and a plastic bag with spare dry clothes in case it rained so I didn’t get a cold. When I got out of the four-wheel drive I could feel the refreshing cool air, it smelt like it had been raining for ages before I came to the rainforest. I decided to explore the forest floor.The first animal I saw was a magnificent, giant eastern brown snake. I was so scared I felt like I wanted to run but that would be really dangerous!The second animal I spotted was a beetle eating a rotten berry. I bent down to have a closer look but it stank like rotten eggs and onion mixed together. Then I turned to the right and saw a bowerbird collecting lots of blue stuff like wrappers and blue flowers. It had beautiful, magnificent, midnight-blue eyes and it looked very graceful.By now I had seen enough on the forest floor so I decided to go to the understorey. So I went to the bridge in the understorey 20m high off the forest floor. The first animal I saw in the understorey was a massive, graceful, blue butterfly sucking pollen off a beautiful orchid. That was my favourite animal so far of all the animals I saw.The second animal I spotted was a black bat hanging upside down on the branch near me. Before I arrived at the rainforest I thought we wouldn’t see a bat because I was going in the day and bats are nocturnal.The third animal I spotted was a grey Boyd’s dragon it was eating lots of bugs and beetles. I looked down to the forest floor and saw a little stream, it had a cute, little platypus looking after her five tiny, mini babies.By now I had had enough of the understorey so I decided to go up the ladder to the canopy. I already knew that we would see lots of brightly coloured birds in the canopy. I went up the ladder and on the way up I already saw lots of birds and lots of berries and colourful, beautiful, rainbow flowers. When I got to the canopy I was 30 m high.The first animal I saw in the canopy was a Crimson Rosella it was eating seeds off some beautiful flowers. The Crimson Rosella was dark red and midnight-blue on its tail and wings. I could see the emergent trees 50m tall off the ground. I saw a wedge-tail eagle looking for food and other little animals.I had a great time because I liked the rainforest. The most terrifying animal was the eastern brown snake. I liked the blue butterfly the best of all the animals.Question:1. What is the topic of the text ?2. How many animals did the writer see during his adventure ?3. What thing was the writer most interested in ?​</a>

I had never had pimple before, so the whole day i had to cover m forehead with a hed band.</a>

                                            A Donkey and A Lapdog  Once upon a time there was a farmer who owned a little dog that he keeps constantly by his side and a donkey, which lived in a warm stable and got plenty of fresh grain and sweet hay. But, unfortunately the donkey was not satisfied with his condition.  "I slave all day long, hauling wood or pulling the cart to market while the dog sleeps on the master's lap and eats from his plate!," the donkey grumbled. "Perhaps, he thought, if he behaved like the dog, his master would reward him with the same life of ease.  That very night, the donkey crept out of the stable and into the house where the farmer sat at supper. "First I'll frisk about and chase my tail, just as the dog does," thought the donkey. And he danced about the room, flinging up his hooves until the table toppled over and dishes went flying.  "Now I'll sit on his lap!" said the donkey, and he put his hooves up on the master's chair.  "Help! Save me from this mad beast!" the terrified farmer bellowed. Then his servants came running and, with shouts and blows, drove the donkey back to the stable.  "I suppose I' m a fine donkey, "the donkey lamented," but I' ll never be a lapdog!" Moral of the Story- What's right for one may be wrong for another. So, never try to copy another person in front of you. 
Why did the donkey act like the dog 
A) because he not satisfied with his condition
B) he want a good stable like the dog </a>

                        d.

Namun Yuki menolak karena ingin fokus terhadap studinya. Dan Alasan Monika menyukai Yuki adalah karena Yuki berbeda dimata Monika, Yuki tampan, pintar dan penuh perhatian.

Somehow they overlooked me on that one and I am forced to slug it out here through another frigid and snowy Montreal winter. Brrr! I heard through the grapevine that business is going well there.

Or, if your car breaks down in the middle of the night in a strange neighborhood, it would be dangerous to leave it in search of a public phone booth. My other main reason is that mobile phones are convenient for business people. For example, if you are out of the state or even overseas and you have to contact a client to do some important work, it is useful to have one to use. By using a mobile phone, important information can be received. People can't stay in an office all day waiting for their phone to ring. Some people have to go and do jobs or they will go out of business. You can even send faxes or messages and use the internet with your mobile. In conclusion, I believe that mobile phones have now become a necessary part of everyday life. Instant communication will ensure that information can be passed on with a simple press of a button. Whether this is to do with business or personal information or emergencies, it goes to show that they are necessary in the new millennium. 26. What is the best tittle text above? 27.

It is possible to use a laptop or computer to access the Internet, but mobile phones are more convenient as they can be used anywhere and anytime. People who do not use mobile phones also find it harder to contact people, especially in emergencies, as finding a public phone booth is hard nowadays because most people already have mobile phones.

                            16. Once upon a time there was a farmer who owned a little dog that he keeps constantly by his side and a donkey, which lived in a warm stable and got plenty of fresh grain and sweet hay. But, unfortunately the donkey was not satisfied with his condition.
"I slave all day long, hauling wood or pulling the cart to market while the dog sleeps on the master's lap and eats from his plate!," the donkey grumbled. "Perhaps, he thought, if he behaved like the dog, his master would reward him with the same life of ease.
That very night, the donkey crept out of the stable and into the house where the farmer sat at supper. "First I'll frisk about and chase my tail, just as the dog does," thought the donkey. And he danced about the room, flinging up his hooves until the table toppled over and dishes went flying.
"Now I'll sit on his lap!" said the donkey, and he put his hooves up on the master's chair.
"Help! Save me from this mad beast!" the terrified farmer bellowed. Then his servants came running and, with shouts and blows, drove the donkey back to the stable.
"I suppose I' m a fine donkey, "the donkey lamented," but I'll never be a lapdog!"

                            17. 2. What is the tone of this poem by Philip Henry Savage? Even in the city, I Am ever conscious of the sky; A portion of its frame no less Than in the open wilderness. The stars are in my heart by night, I sing beneath the opening light, As envious of the bird; I live Upon the payment, yet I give My soul to every growing tree That in the narrow ways I see. My heart is in the blade of grass Within the courtyard where I pass; And the small, half-discovered cloud Compels me till I cry aloud. I am the wind that beats the walls And wander trembling till it falls; The snow, the summer rain am I, In close communion with the sky. Pilih jawaban: Objective Sarcastic Neutral Subjective Formal 3.

Rose sat all alone in the big best parlor, with her little handkerchief laid ready to catch the first tear, for she was thinking of her troubles, and a shower was expected. She had retired to this room as a good place in which to be miserable; for it was dark and still, full of ancient furniture, sombre curtains, and hung all around with portraits of solemn old gentlemen in wigs, severe-nosed ladies in top-heavy caps, and staring children in little bob-tailed coats or short-waisted frocks. It was an excellent place for woe; and the fitful spring rain that pattered on the window-pane seemed to sob, "Cry away: I'm with you." Pilih jawaban: Neutral Bored Sad Happy Angry 4.

But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with hesitation, "You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have not killed anything."

They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, an sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins. "This must be the Land of Oz," said Dorothy, "and we are surely getting near the Emerald City." "Yes," answered the Scarecrow.

Hundreds of years ago the Dayak tribe known as one of the most powerful tribes in the world. The tribe lives side by side with their beloved nature peacefully.
This condition has made most of the Dayak men grow as the son of the jungle and well known as the best hunters ever.
There was one animal that cannot be tranquil live side by side. The animal was the crocodile.
One day, a Dayak man who was a good hunter went to the jungle to hunt some animals that can be a cook for his family as a dinner.
The sky was getting dark when he returned home carrying four jungle fowls.
At the end of the forest, near a big river, he startled to see a large crocodile on the path in front of him. The crocodile was staring at him in a strange way.
The man who was aware of the cruelness and bad temper of the crocodile. He tried to avoid the dangerous situation by starting a friendly conversation.
"Where are you going, Mr. Crocodile?" he asked.
"I m looking for some food and was starting swimming up. But then, as I saw you my spirit rose again." said the satirist crocodile.
"Well, why don't you come home with me? I am sure my wife will be happy to cook something for you. Or we can cook these two jungle fowls and have dinner together."
The Dayak thought it was the best way for him to answer the crocodile. He was afraid that if he did not treat the crocodile politely. The crocodile would be angry and tried to eat him up in a tricky way.
"Thank you," replied the crocodile.
"It was an exciting invitation." He was curious to see how the Dayaks lived as had never visited one of their houses before.
Besides, the man was friendly and could talk to him well. It would be an excellent chance for him. An opportunity to live with the Dayak tribe.
The crocodile eats the meal from Mrs. Dayak had cooked for him.
Then the crocodile said, "I feel welcome and comfortable here. Can I stay with you any longer?"
"Oh, of course," the Dayak said.
He thought that it would make him became a talented man because a crocodile was staying at his house.
"Why don't you allow him to marry our daughter?" his wife asked one day.
"You must be out of your mind!" her husband cried.
"Well, is there something wrong with my idea? Have you never heard the old Dayak story about the crocodile that married a girl? They will change into a handsome and rich young man?"
"I don't believe in fairy stories," Her husband said.
"In real life, it would be possible if you do not like creature like a crocodile to marry a young girl."
"All right," she answered.
"Even if he's not a handsome, wealthy, young man, he will have to work to support you. That's the Dayak custom, don't you remember?"
Finally, the man agreed with his wife's idea. He allowed the crocodile to marry his daughter. He the hope that the crocodile will always support his family.
As the time has gone by, the man soon found out that his son-in-law was lazy and good for nothing. The crocodile only wanted to lie in the sun all day long and show his sharp teeth from time to time.
He refused to do any work. He would not even catch fish for his wife. One day, his father-in-law's supply of rice was lacking. Mr. Dayak tried to force the crocodile to work in the rice field.
The crocodile refused to do the job. The crocodile threatened Mr. Dayak to give him more food. The crocodile opens his tribe-looking mouth and showing his sharp teeth.
The news of this condition spread to the other villagers. All the villagers soon hated the crocodile.
"What must we do?" they asked each other.
"If we keep quite, all the crocodiles will think that we're afraid of them. We must find a solution to teach the crocodile a good lesson."
Thus one day, while he was sleeping, they jumped on him. They cut into pieces.
The news of what had happened quickly reached the king of the crocodiles. Surprisingly enough, he agreed with what the Dayaks had done.
"Customs are important," he whispered.
"They must always to follow. As he married a Dayak girl, he should have followed the Dayaks customs. He deserved what he got.".
So to this day, a crocodile will not dare to look Dayak in the face or do any harm to him.</h2><br />

 I know that I a m running out of time 
I want it all
And I am wishing they “d stop tryna turn me off.
I want it on
And I am walking on a wire
Trying to go higher

Just like magic, I will be flying free
I am disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling , What you gonna say ?

                            31. “My Rainforest Adventure”Today I woke up at 5:00a in the morning. I put on my loose fitting shirt, trousers, sturdy black boots with little holes in them, wide brimmed hat and a plastic bag with spare dry clothes in case it rained so I didn’t get a cold. When I got out of the four-wheel drive I could feel the refreshing cool air, it smelt like it had been raining for ages before I came to the rainforest. I decided to explore the forest floor.The first animal I saw was a magnificent, giant eastern brown snake. I was so scared I felt like I wanted to run but that would be really dangerous!The second animal I spotted was a beetle eating a rotten berry. I bent down to have a closer look but it stank like rotten eggs and onion mixed together. Then I turned to the right and saw a bowerbird collecting lots of blue stuff like wrappers and blue flowers. It had beautiful, magnificent, midnight-blue eyes and it looked very graceful.By now I had seen enough on the forest floor so I decided to go to the understorey. So I went to the bridge in the understorey 20m high off the forest floor. The first animal I saw in the understorey was a massive, graceful, blue butterfly sucking pollen off a beautiful orchid. That was my favourite animal so far of all the animals I saw.The second animal I spotted was a black bat hanging upside down on the branch near me. Before I arrived at the rainforest I thought we wouldn’t see a bat because I was going in the day and bats are nocturnal.The third animal I spotted was a grey Boyd’s dragon it was eating lots of bugs and beetles. I looked down to the forest floor and saw a little stream, it had a cute, little platypus looking after her five tiny, mini babies.By now I had had enough of the understorey so I decided to go up the ladder to the canopy. I already knew that we would see lots of brightly coloured birds in the canopy. I went up the ladder and on the way up I already saw lots of birds and lots of berries and colourful, beautiful, rainbow flowers. When I got to the canopy I was 30 m high.The first animal I saw in the canopy was a Crimson Rosella it was eating seeds off some beautiful flowers. The Crimson Rosella was dark red and midnight-blue on its tail and wings. I could see the emergent trees 50m tall off the ground. I saw a wedge-tail eagle looking for food and other little animals.I had a great time because I liked the rainforest. The most terrifying animal was the eastern brown snake. I liked the blue butterfly the best of all the animals.Question:1. What is the topic of the text ?2. How many animals did the writer see during his adventure ?3.

                        Aku punya pengalaman yang buruk siang ini. Kemarin, pestanya berlangsung seru. Saat aku bangun tadi pagi, aku merasa sangat senang tentang pesta semalam. Aku melakukan segala rutinitasku dan pergi ke sekolah. Saat aku sampai di sekolah dan masuk ke dalam kelas, semuanya melihatku. Aku bertanya-tanya, "Mengapa mereka melihatiku?" Aku tidak memikirkan itu terlalu dalam, aku duduk di tempat biasa. Tiba-tiba semua menunjuk ke arah wajahku. Aku merasa sangat malu. Aku berlari ke kamar mandi. Aku sangat terkejut melihat jerawat merah yang besar ada di dahiku. Teman-teman sekelasku menertawakanku, karena aku terlihat seperti artis India. Aku tidak pernah memiliki jerawat sebelumnya. Dengan sangat terpaksa aku harus menutupi dahiku menggunakan topi satu hari penuh.I
 had a bad experince this morning yesterday. The party was very good. 
When I wake up this morning I felt very happy about the party. <br />
I got on with my usually morning activities and went to school. When i 
arrived at school and entered classroom, everybody was looking at me. I 
wondered. <br />
"Why are they looking at me ??" <br />
I did'n think about it much , so I sat in my usually chair. Suddenly, 
all of pointing at my face. I felt very embarrassed. So I ran to the

                            40. A Donkey and A Lapdog  Once upon a time there was a farmer who owned a little dog that he keeps constantly by his side and a donkey, which lived in a warm stable and got plenty of fresh grain and sweet hay. But, unfortunately the donkey was not satisfied with his condition.  "I slave all day long, hauling wood or pulling the cart to market while the dog sleeps on the master's lap and eats from his plate!," the donkey grumbled. "Perhaps, he thought, if he behaved like the dog, his master would reward him with the same life of ease.  That very night, the donkey crept out of the stable and into the house where the farmer sat at supper. "First I'll frisk about and chase my tail, just as the dog does," thought the donkey. And he danced about the room, flinging up his hooves until the table toppled over and dishes went flying.  "Now I'll sit on his lap!" said the donkey, and he put his hooves up on the master's chair.  "Help! Save me from this mad beast!" the terrified farmer bellowed. Then his servants came running and, with shouts and blows, drove the donkey back to the stable.  "I suppose I' m a fine donkey, "the donkey lamented," but I' ll never be a lapdog!" Moral of the Story- What's right for one may be wrong for another. So, never try to copy another person in front of you. 
Why did the donkey act like the dog 
A) because he not satisfied with his condition
B) he want a good stable like the dog </h2><br />
                        The answer is...<br />A) Because he's not satisfied with his condition<br /><br />It's mentioned in the story itself ;<br />"But, unfortunately the donkey was not satisfied with his condition"<br /><br />;)<br />
