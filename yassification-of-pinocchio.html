                                            PINOCCHIO
        Many years ago, there lived a poor man named Geppetto. He made puppets from pieces of wood. He called his favorite puppet Pinocchio. “I would love to be a father to a real boy, “ he wished.
            That night, a fairy who knew Geppetto was a good man, cost a magic spell over Pinocchio, Pinocchio.
            The very next day, Gappetto awake and was very happy to find that Pinocchio could walk, sit and talk. Poor Gappeto wanted to send Pinocchio to school. He sold his only coat for a spelling book.
            “Now you can go to school like a real boy. “Said Gappetto as we waved goodbye to Pinocchio.
            On the way to school, Pinocchio stopped to wacth a puppet show in a town. “How would you like to join my puppet show? Asked the evil puppet master. Pinocchio happily agreed. He was locked inside the evil puppet master’s caravan. He wished he was safe with Gappetto. The good fairy suddenly appeared. She had heard Pinocchio’s wish and set him free. Pinocchio is happy to be free. “I’m going straight to school,” he said.
            On the way, he met an evil fox who told him all about  a wonderful place called fun island. Pinocchio forgot all about school and gave the fox his spelling book in return for a ticket to Fun island.
            “Where are you going, Pinocchio? Asked good fairy. I’m on the way to school, “ lied Pinocchio. Pinocchio‘s nose grew very, very long. He wished he hadn’t told a lie. The fairy called a bird to peck of his long nose because  Pinocchio was very sorry. Pinocchio promised never to be naughty ever again and went straight to school.
            At school, Pinocchio told his friend all about fun island. His friend wanted to go with him. Pinocchio and his hurriedly climbed aboard a ship that was going to Fun Island.
            On the island they didn’t know that little boys were turned into donkeys and used for very hard work. Pinocchio cried and wished he hadn’t come the island. He also wished didn’t look like a silly donkey. The fairy had heard his wish and with a wave of her magic wand his donkey ears and tail disappeared. Pinocchio sad on the shore, sadly looking out to the sea. He wondered if he would ever see Geppetto again.
            Suddenly he saw Geppetto who had sailed out to the sea in search of Pinocchio. Geppetto didn’t see the huge whale behind him. The whale swallowed Geppetto and his boat. Pinocchio knew he had to save Geppetto. He jumped into the water and swam with all his might. As he got closer, the whale open  his mouth and Pinocchio swam right in. Deep inside the whale’s belly, Pinocchio and Geppetto hugged each other, happy to be together again.
            “We must find a way out, “Said Geppetto, “We will make a fire from the wood of my boat.” The smoke made the whale sneeze. They shot out of the whale’s mouth and back into the sea.
            Pinocchio and Geppetto swam safely to shore. They were both tired. They laid on the sand and fell asleep.
            When Geppetto awoke, Pinocchio had become a real boy. “At last my wish has come true!” cried Geppetto.

Pinokio
.
Di masa lalu, ada seorang pembuat boneka kayu yang bernama Geppetto. Dia ingin sekali memiliki anak laki-laki tapi istrinya meninggal beberapa tahun sebelumnya. Suatu hari, ia mendapat ide untuk membuat boneka agar tidak kesepian lagi. Dia membuat boneka kayu itu sepanjang hari. Akhirnya, di pagi hari ia selesai mengerjakannya dan dia beri nama boneka itu Pinocchio. Setelah itu ia merasa kesepian lagi karena Pinocchio tidak bisa berjalan atau berbicar. Suatu malam, Geppetto berdoa kepada Tuhan untuk menjadikannya seorang anak yang nyata. Dia selalu memikirkan itu dalam pikirannya.
Pada keesokan harinya, ia terkejut karena Pinocchio hidup. Dia mengajari Pinocchio cara berjalan, cara membaca, cara berbicara dan melakukan hal-hal lain selayaknya manusia. Dia kemudian belajar di sebuah sekolah dasar. Suatu hari, Pinocchio merasa bosan dan itu membuatnya pulang terlambat. Ketika Pinocchio akhirnya pulang, Geppetto bertanya. Dia mengatakan bahwa ia berada di sekolah tapi sebenarnya dia tidak di sekolah. Seketika, hidung Pinokio tumbuh lebih panjang lagi dan lagi dan itu berarti bahwa Pinocchio telah berbohong.
Keesokan paginya, Pinocchio diculik oleh seorang pemilik sirkus. Pinocchio kemudian menjadi budak untuk sirkus tersebut. Dia begitu terkenal karena ia adalah boneka yang bisa bicara. Geppetto khawatir tentang dia karena Pinocchio belum pulang selama hampir dua hari. Dia mencoba untuk menemukan Pinocchio mana-mana tapi ia tidak menemukannya. Ketika ia mencari dia di laut, gelombang besar menghempaskan dirinya. Dia kemudian berada di perut ikan paus ketika ia terbangun. Dia tidak bisa menemukan cara untuk pergi keluar dari sana.
Di sisi lain, Pinocchio akhirnya bisa melarikan diri keluar dari sirkus itu. Dia pulang tapi tidak ada siapa-siapa di rumahnya. Akhirnya, ia mencari Geppetto di laut. Dia mendapat kecelakaan yang sama seperti yang dialami Geppetto dan ia bertemu Geppetto dalam perut ikan paus. Keduanya keluar dari perut tersebut dengan membuat api. Di akhir cerita, mereka pulang bersama-sama dan hidup bahagia selamanya.</a>

Pinokio
.
Di masa lalu, ada seorang pembuat boneka kayu yang bernama Geppetto. Dia ingin sekali memiliki anak laki-laki tapi istrinya meninggal beberapa tahun sebelumnya. Suatu hari, ia mendapat ide untuk membuat boneka agar tidak kesepian lagi. Dia membuat boneka kayu itu sepanjang hari. Akhirnya, di pagi hari ia selesai mengerjakannya dan dia beri nama boneka itu Pinocchio. Setelah itu ia merasa kesepian lagi karena Pinocchio tidak bisa berjalan atau berbicar. Suatu malam, Geppetto berdoa kepada Tuhan untuk menjadikannya seorang anak yang nyata. Dia selalu memikirkan itu dalam pikirannya.
Pada keesokan harinya, ia terkejut karena Pinocchio hidup. Dia mengajari Pinocchio cara berjalan, cara membaca, cara berbicara dan melakukan hal-hal lain selayaknya manusia. Dia kemudian belajar di sebuah sekolah dasar. Suatu hari, Pinocchio merasa bosan dan itu membuatnya pulang terlambat. Ketika Pinocchio akhirnya pulang, Geppetto bertanya. Dia mengatakan bahwa ia berada di sekolah tapi sebenarnya dia tidak di sekolah. Seketika, hidung Pinokio tumbuh lebih panjang lagi dan lagi dan itu berarti bahwa Pinocchio telah berbohong.
Keesokan paginya, Pinocchio diculik oleh seorang pemilik sirkus. Pinocchio kemudian menjadi budak untuk sirkus tersebut. Dia begitu terkenal karena ia adalah boneka yang bisa bicara. Geppetto khawatir tentang dia karena Pinocchio belum pulang selama hampir dua hari. Dia mencoba untuk menemukan Pinocchio mana-mana tapi ia tidak menemukannya. Ketika ia mencari dia di laut, gelombang besar menghempaskan dirinya. Dia kemudian berada di perut ikan paus ketika ia terbangun. Dia tidak bisa menemukan cara untuk pergi keluar dari sana.
Di sisi lain, Pinocchio akhirnya bisa melarikan diri keluar dari sirkus itu. Dia pulang tapi tidak ada siapa-siapa di rumahnya. Akhirnya, ia mencari Geppetto di laut. Dia mendapat kecelakaan yang sama seperti yang dialami Geppetto dan ia bertemu Geppetto dalam perut ikan paus. Keduanya keluar dari perut tersebut dengan membuat api. Di akhir cerita, mereka pulang bersama-sama dan hidup bahagia selamanya.</a>

Pinokio
.
Di masa lalu, ada seorang pembuat boneka kayu yang bernama Geppetto. Dia ingin sekali memiliki anak laki-laki tapi istrinya meninggal beberapa tahun sebelumnya. Suatu hari, ia mendapat ide untuk membuat boneka agar tidak kesepian lagi. Dia membuat boneka kayu itu sepanjang hari. Akhirnya, di pagi hari ia selesai mengerjakannya dan dia beri nama boneka itu Pinocchio. Setelah itu ia merasa kesepian lagi karena Pinocchio tidak bisa berjalan atau berbicar. Suatu malam, Geppetto berdoa kepada Tuhan untuk menjadikannya seorang anak yang nyata. Dia selalu memikirkan itu dalam pikirannya.
Pada keesokan harinya, ia terkejut karena Pinocchio hidup. Dia mengajari Pinocchio cara berjalan, cara membaca, cara berbicara dan melakukan hal-hal lain selayaknya manusia. Dia kemudian belajar di sebuah sekolah dasar. Suatu hari, Pinocchio merasa bosan dan itu membuatnya pulang terlambat. Ketika Pinocchio akhirnya pulang, Geppetto bertanya. Dia mengatakan bahwa ia berada di sekolah tapi sebenarnya dia tidak di sekolah. Seketika, hidung Pinokio tumbuh lebih panjang lagi dan lagi dan itu berarti bahwa Pinocchio telah berbohong.
Keesokan paginya, Pinocchio diculik oleh seorang pemilik sirkus. Pinocchio kemudian menjadi budak untuk sirkus tersebut. Dia begitu terkenal karena ia adalah boneka yang bisa bicara. Geppetto khawatir tentang dia karena Pinocchio belum pulang selama hampir dua hari. Dia mencoba untuk menemukan Pinocchio mana-mana tapi ia tidak menemukannya. Ketika ia mencari dia di laut, gelombang besar menghempaskan dirinya. Dia kemudian berada di perut ikan paus ketika ia terbangun. Dia tidak bisa menemukan cara untuk pergi keluar dari sana.
Di sisi lain, Pinocchio akhirnya bisa melarikan diri keluar dari sirkus itu. Dia pulang tapi tidak ada siapa-siapa di rumahnya. Akhirnya, ia mencari Geppetto di laut. Dia mendapat kecelakaan yang sama seperti yang dialami Geppetto dan ia bertemu Geppetto dalam perut ikan paus. Keduanya keluar dari perut tersebut dengan membuat api. Di akhir cerita, mereka pulang bersama-sama dan hidup bahagia selamanya.</a>

                            6. PINOCCHIO
        Many years ago, there lived a poor man named Geppetto. He made puppets from pieces of wood. He called his favorite puppet Pinocchio. “I would love to be a father to a real boy, “ he wished.
            That night, a fairy who knew Geppetto was a good man, cost a magic spell over Pinocchio, Pinocchio.
            The very next day, Gappetto awake and was very happy to find that Pinocchio could walk, sit and talk. Poor Gappeto wanted to send Pinocchio to school. He sold his only coat for a spelling book.
            “Now you can go to school like a real boy. “Said Gappetto as we waved goodbye to Pinocchio.
            On the way to school, Pinocchio stopped to wacth a puppet show in a town. “How would you like to join my puppet show? Asked the evil puppet master. Pinocchio happily agreed. He was locked inside the evil puppet master’s caravan. He wished he was safe with Gappetto. The good fairy suddenly appeared. She had heard Pinocchio’s wish and set him free. Pinocchio is happy to be free. “I’m going straight to school,” he said.
            On the way, he met an evil fox who told him all about  a wonderful place called fun island. Pinocchio forgot all about school and gave the fox his spelling book in return for a ticket to Fun island.
            “Where are you going, Pinocchio? Asked good fairy. I’m on the way to school, “ lied Pinocchio. Pinocchio‘s nose grew very, very long. He wished he hadn’t told a lie. The fairy called a bird to peck of his long nose because  Pinocchio was very sorry. Pinocchio promised never to be naughty ever again and went straight to school.
            At school, Pinocchio told his friend all about fun island. His friend wanted to go with him. Pinocchio and his hurriedly climbed aboard a ship that was going to Fun Island.
            On the island they didn’t know that little boys were turned into donkeys and used for very hard work. Pinocchio cried and wished he hadn’t come the island. He also wished didn’t look like a silly donkey. The fairy had heard his wish and with a wave of her magic wand his donkey ears and tail disappeared. Pinocchio sad on the shore, sadly looking out to the sea. He wondered if he would ever see Geppetto again.
            Suddenly he saw Geppetto who had sailed out to the sea in search of Pinocchio. Geppetto didn’t see the huge whale behind him. The whale swallowed Geppetto and his boat. Pinocchio knew he had to save Geppetto. He jumped into the water and swam with all his might. As he got closer, the whale open  his mouth and Pinocchio swam right in. Deep inside the whale’s belly, Pinocchio and Geppetto hugged each other, happy to be together again.
            “We must find a way out, “Said Geppetto, “We will make a fire from the wood of my boat.” The smoke made the whale sneeze. They shot out of the whale’s mouth and back into the sea.
            Pinocchio and Geppetto swam safely to shore. They were both tired. They laid on the sand and fell asleep.
            When Geppetto awoke, Pinocchio had become a real boy. “At last my wish has come true!” cried Geppetto.

Pinokio
.
Di masa lalu, ada seorang pembuat boneka kayu yang bernama Geppetto. Dia ingin sekali memiliki anak laki-laki tapi istrinya meninggal beberapa tahun sebelumnya. Suatu hari, ia mendapat ide untuk membuat boneka agar tidak kesepian lagi. Dia membuat boneka kayu itu sepanjang hari. Akhirnya, di pagi hari ia selesai mengerjakannya dan dia beri nama boneka itu Pinocchio. Setelah itu ia merasa kesepian lagi karena Pinocchio tidak bisa berjalan atau berbicar. Suatu malam, Geppetto berdoa kepada Tuhan untuk menjadikannya seorang anak yang nyata. Dia selalu memikirkan itu dalam pikirannya.
Pada keesokan harinya, ia terkejut karena Pinocchio hidup. Dia mengajari Pinocchio cara berjalan, cara membaca, cara berbicara dan melakukan hal-hal lain selayaknya manusia. Dia kemudian belajar di sebuah sekolah dasar. Suatu hari, Pinocchio merasa bosan dan itu membuatnya pulang terlambat. Ketika Pinocchio akhirnya pulang, Geppetto bertanya. Dia mengatakan bahwa ia berada di sekolah tapi sebenarnya dia tidak di sekolah. Seketika, hidung Pinokio tumbuh lebih panjang lagi dan lagi dan itu berarti bahwa Pinocchio telah berbohong.
Keesokan paginya, Pinocchio diculik oleh seorang pemilik sirkus. Pinocchio kemudian menjadi budak untuk sirkus tersebut. Dia begitu terkenal karena ia adalah boneka yang bisa bicara. Geppetto khawatir tentang dia karena Pinocchio belum pulang selama hampir dua hari. Dia mencoba untuk menemukan Pinocchio mana-mana tapi ia tidak menemukannya. Ketika ia mencari dia di laut, gelombang besar menghempaskan dirinya. Dia kemudian berada di perut ikan paus ketika ia terbangun. Dia tidak bisa menemukan cara untuk pergi keluar dari sana.
Di sisi lain, Pinocchio akhirnya bisa melarikan diri keluar dari sirkus itu. Dia pulang tapi tidak ada siapa-siapa di rumahnya. Akhirnya, ia mencari Geppetto di laut. Dia mendapat kecelakaan yang sama seperti yang dialami Geppetto dan ia bertemu Geppetto dalam perut ikan paus. Keduanya keluar dari perut tersebut dengan membuat api. Di akhir cerita, mereka pulang bersama-sama dan hidup bahagia selamanya.</h2><br />

Pinokio
.
Di masa lalu, ada seorang pembuat boneka kayu yang bernama Geppetto. Dia ingin sekali memiliki anak laki-laki tapi istrinya meninggal beberapa tahun sebelumnya. Suatu hari, ia mendapat ide untuk membuat boneka agar tidak kesepian lagi. Dia membuat boneka kayu itu sepanjang hari. Akhirnya, di pagi hari ia selesai mengerjakannya dan dia beri nama boneka itu Pinocchio. Setelah itu ia merasa kesepian lagi karena Pinocchio tidak bisa berjalan atau berbicar. Suatu malam, Geppetto berdoa kepada Tuhan untuk menjadikannya seorang anak yang nyata. Dia selalu memikirkan itu dalam pikirannya.
Pada keesokan harinya, ia terkejut karena Pinocchio hidup. Dia mengajari Pinocchio cara berjalan, cara membaca, cara berbicara dan melakukan hal-hal lain selayaknya manusia. Dia kemudian belajar di sebuah sekolah dasar. Suatu hari, Pinocchio merasa bosan dan itu membuatnya pulang terlambat. Ketika Pinocchio akhirnya pulang, Geppetto bertanya. Dia mengatakan bahwa ia berada di sekolah tapi sebenarnya dia tidak di sekolah. Seketika, hidung Pinokio tumbuh lebih panjang lagi dan lagi dan itu berarti bahwa Pinocchio telah berbohong.
Keesokan paginya, Pinocchio diculik oleh seorang pemilik sirkus. Pinocchio kemudian menjadi budak untuk sirkus tersebut. Dia begitu terkenal karena ia adalah boneka yang bisa bicara. Geppetto khawatir tentang dia karena Pinocchio belum pulang selama hampir dua hari. Dia mencoba untuk menemukan Pinocchio mana-mana tapi ia tidak menemukannya. Ketika ia mencari dia di laut, gelombang besar menghempaskan dirinya. Dia kemudian berada di perut ikan paus ketika ia terbangun. Dia tidak bisa menemukan cara untuk pergi keluar dari sana.
Di sisi lain, Pinocchio akhirnya bisa melarikan diri keluar dari sirkus itu. Dia pulang tapi tidak ada siapa-siapa di rumahnya. Akhirnya, ia mencari Geppetto di laut. Dia mendapat kecelakaan yang sama seperti yang dialami Geppetto dan ia bertemu Geppetto dalam perut ikan paus. Keduanya keluar dari perut tersebut dengan membuat api. Di akhir cerita, mereka pulang bersama-sama dan hidup bahagia selamanya.</h2><br />

Di masa lalu, ada seorang pembuat boneka kayu yang bernama Geppetto. Dia ingin sekali memiliki anak laki-laki tapi istrinya meninggal beberapa tahun sebelumnya. Suatu hari, ia mendapat ide untuk membuat boneka agar tidak kesepian lagi. Dia membuat boneka kayu itu sepanjang hari. Akhirnya, di pagi hari ia selesai mengerjakannya dan dia beri nama boneka itu Pinocchio. Setelah itu ia merasa kesepian lagi karena Pinocchio tidak bisa berjalan atau berbicar. Suatu malam, Geppetto berdoa kepada Tuhan untuk menjadikannya seorang anak yang nyata. Dia selalu memikirkan itu dalam pikirannya.
Pada keesokan harinya, ia terkejut karena Pinocchio hidup. Dia mengajari Pinocchio cara berjalan, cara membaca, cara berbicara dan melakukan hal-hal lain selayaknya manusia. Dia kemudian belajar di sebuah sekolah dasar. Suatu hari, Pinocchio merasa bosan dan itu membuatnya pulang terlambat. Ketika Pinocchio akhirnya pulang, Geppetto bertanya. Dia mengatakan bahwa ia berada di sekolah tapi sebenarnya dia tidak di sekolah. Seketika, hidung Pinokio tumbuh lebih panjang lagi dan lagi dan itu berarti bahwa Pinocchio telah berbohong.
Keesokan paginya, Pinocchio diculik oleh seorang pemilik sirkus. Pinocchio kemudian menjadi budak untuk sirkus tersebut. Dia begitu terkenal karena ia adalah boneka yang bisa bicara. Geppetto khawatir tentang dia karena Pinocchio belum pulang selama hampir dua hari. Dia mencoba untuk menemukan Pinocchio mana-mana tapi ia tidak menemukannya. Ketika ia mencari dia di laut, gelombang besar menghempaskan dirinya. Dia kemudian berada di perut ikan paus ketika ia terbangun. Dia tidak bisa menemukan cara untuk pergi keluar dari sana.
Di sisi lain, Pinocchio akhirnya bisa melarikan diri keluar dari sirkus itu. Dia pulang tapi tidak ada siapa-siapa di rumahnya. Akhirnya, ia mencari Geppetto di laut. Dia mendapat kecelakaan yang sama seperti yang dialami Geppetto dan ia bertemu Geppetto dalam perut ikan paus. Keduanya keluar dari perut tersebut dengan membuat api. Di akhir cerita, mereka pulang bersama-sama dan hidup bahagia selamanya.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Pinokio</p><p></p><p>Dulu, ada seorang dalang bernama Geppetto. Dia sangat ingin memiliki seorang putra tetapi istrinya meninggal beberapa tahun yang lalu. Suatu hari, ia mendapat ide untuk membuat boneka agar tidak kesepian lagi. Dia membuat boneka sepanjang hari. Akhirnya, di pagi hari dia menyelesaikan pekerjaannya dan dia menamai boneka itu Pinokio. Segera dia merasa kesepian lagi karena Pinokio tidak dapat berjalan atau berbicara sendiri. Suatu malam, Geppetto berdoa kepada Tuhan agar menjadi anak laki-laki sejati. Dia selalu memikirkannya dalam mimpinya.</p><p></p><p>Keesokan paginya, dia terkejut bahwa Pinokio masih hidup. Dia mengajari Pinokio cara berjalan, membaca, berbicara, dan melakukan hal-hal lain sebagai manusia. Dia kemudian belajar di sekolah dasar. Suatu hari, Pinokio merasa bosan dan itu membuatnya pulang terlambat. Ketika Pinokio akhirnya pulang, Geppetto bertanya padanya. Dia mengatakan bahwa dia ada di sekolah tetapi tidak. Seketika, hidung Pinokio bertambah panjang dan panjang, itu artinya Pinokio telah berbohong.</p><p></p><p>Keesokan paginya, Pinokio diculik oleh pemilik sirkus. Pinokio segera menjadi budak sirkus. Ia sangat terkenal karena ia adalah seorang boneka yang bisa berbicara. Geppetto mengkhawatirkannya karena Pinokio sudah hampir dua hari tidak pulang. Dia mencoba menemukan Pinokio di mana-mana tetapi dia tidak menemukan apa pun. Ketika dia mencarinya di laut, ombak besar menghantamnya. Dia kemudian berada di perut ikan paus ketika dia bangun. Dia tidak dapat menemukan cara untuk keluar.</p><p></p><p>Di sisi lain, Pinokio akhirnya bisa kabur dari sirkus. Dia pulang tapi tidak ada orang di sana. Belakangan, dia mencari Geppetto di laut. Dia mengalami kecelakaan yang sama seperti Geppetto dan dia bertemu Geppetto di perut ikan paus. Keduanya keluar dari perutnya dengan membuat api. Di akhir cerita, mereka pulang bersama dan hidup bahagia selamanya</p><p></p><p>jawab pertanyaannya</p><p>1. Cerita tentang apa yang diceritakan kepada kita?</p><p>2. Apa struktur umum teks?</p><p>3.
