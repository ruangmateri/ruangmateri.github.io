He wrote a book about his travels thatbecame one of the most famous travel guides in history. They called him "the man with amillion stories." Marco Polo was born in 1254 to a family of merchants. His home was Venice,Italy. Venetian merchants bought and sold valuable Chinese goods, including precious silk cloth.Such goods were brought to Europe along an ancient route known as the Silk Road. The merchantsalso used the route to travel east on trading missions. His family taught him to be a merchant. Helearned how to read, write, calculate, and use foreign money.In 1271. Marco's father and uncle, Niccolo and Maffeo set out for China again. Marco, then17 years old, joined his father and uncle for the trip. It took the Polos four difficult years to reachChina. The journey led across deserts and high mountains. They passed through wild countrysidewhere bandits lurked, ready to rob and kill. They braved heat and cold, floods, deep snowdrifts.and blinding sandstorms. At last they reached the summer palace of the Mongol conqueror. KublaiKhan, at Shangdu,The Khan welcomed the Polos warmly. He offered Marco a job. Marco accepted, and thePolos lived in China for the next 17 years. Marco travelled on many special missions across theKhan's kingdom and to distant lands. When Marco returned from his missions, he told the Khanvivid stories about the people and lands he visited. Over time, the Polos worried that Kublai Khanwould not allow them to leave. Several times they had asked the Khan for permission to returnto Europe. But the khan enjoyed his story so much that he would not grant their wish. Finally, theKhan changed his mind. In 1292. Kublai Khan asked Marco to escort a Mongol princess to Persia.The Polos travelled by ship from China to the Persian Gulf. Then the Polos headed for Venice,finally reaching home in 1295.In 1298, he became a prisoner of war. He shared his cell with a writer named Rustichello, whohelped Marco turned his stories into a book. Marco Polo returned to Venice after his release fromprison. He died in 1324.

Napoleon Bonaparte Emperor of the French, 1769 - 1821 Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769 in Ajaccio on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, the son of Carlo and Letizia Bonaparte. Through his military exploits and his ruthless efficiency, Napoleon rose from obscurity to become Napoleon I, Empereur des Francais (Emperor of the French). He is both a historical figure and a legend—and it is sometimes difficult to separate the two. The events of his life fired the imaginations of great writers, film makers, and playwrights whose works have done much to create the Napoleonic legend. Napoleon decided on a military career when he was a child, winning a scholarship to a French military academy at age 14. His meteoric rise shocked not only France but all of Europe, and his military conquests threatened the stability of the world. Napoleon was one of the greatest military commanders in history. He has also been portrayed as a power hungry conqueror. Napoleon denied those accusations. He argued that he was building a federation of free peoples in a Europe united under a liberal government. But if this was his goal, he intended to achieve it by taking power in his own hands. However, in the states he created, Napoleon granted constitutions, introduced law codes, abolished feudalism, and created efficient governments and fostered education, science, literature and the arts. Emperor Napoleon proved to be an excellent civil administrator. One of his greatest achievements was his supervision of the revision and collection of French law into codes. The new law codes—seven in number—incorporated some of the freedoms gained by the people of France during the French revolution, including religious toleration and the abolition of serfdom. The most famous of the codes, the Code Napoleon or Code Civil, still forms the basis of French civil law. Napoleon also centralized France's government by appointing prefects to administer regions called departments, into which France was divided. While Napoleon believed in government "for" the people, he rejected government "by" the people. His France was a police state with a vast network of secret police and spies. The police shut down plays containing any hint of disagreement or criticism of the government. The press was controlled by the state. It was impossible to express an opinion without Napoleon's approval.</a>

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078, and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. Early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat, a canal that goes around it. The White Tower's purpose was two-fold. It was used for protection: guarding the king and the queen as well as valuables and holding prisoners. It was also used for national security, especially from intimidating London's citizens.The White Tower is large. Most other buildings in London would have been only one story high. The White Tower is around 90 feet high, and would have been visible for miles. It is also strong. It would have been difficult to attach. The walls are up to 15 feet thick. Its only windows were small and low down and the main door was at the top of a wooden staircase. It is built of stone. Almost all London's houses were built of wood. Some of the stone came by ship from Normandy. It was difficult to build. William I and his son forced the Anglo-Saxons from several counties as well as London to work on the building of the White Tower.Questions:1. Where is the Tower of London located?answer:2.

Napoleon Bonaparte Emperor of the French, 1769 - 1821 Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769 in Ajaccio on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, the son of Carlo and Letizia Bonaparte. Through his military exploits and his ruthless efficiency, Napoleon rose from obscurity to become Napoleon I, Empereur des Francais (Emperor of the French). He is both a historical figure and a legend—and it is sometimes difficult to separate the two. The events of his life fired the imaginations of great writers, film makers, and playwrights whose works have done much to create the Napoleonic legend. Napoleon decided on a military career when he was a child, winning a scholarship to a French military academy at age 14. His meteoric rise shocked not only France but all of Europe, and his military conquests threatened the stability of the world. Napoleon was one of the greatest military commanders in history. He has also been portrayed as a power hungry conqueror. Napoleon denied those accusations. He argued that he was building a federation of free peoples in a Europe united under a liberal government. But if this was his goal, he intended to achieve it by taking power in his own hands. However, in the states he created, Napoleon granted constitutions, introduced law codes, abolished feudalism, and created efficient governments and fostered education, science, literature and the arts. Emperor Napoleon proved to be an excellent civil administrator. One of his greatest achievements was his supervision of the revision and collection of French law into codes. The new law codes—seven in number—incorporated some of the freedoms gained by the people of France during the French revolution, including religious toleration and the abolition of serfdom. The most famous of the codes, the Code Napoleon or Code Civil, still forms the basis of French civil law. Napoleon also centralized France's government by appointing prefects to administer regions called departments, into which France was divided. While Napoleon believed in government "for" the people, he rejected government "by" the people. His France was a police state with a vast network of secret police and spies. The police shut down plays containing any hint of disagreement or criticism of the government. The press was controlled by the state. It was impossible to express an opinion without Napoleon's approval.</a>

Ultimately, this Minoan culture did not survive; it was usurped in
regional importance by the Mycenaean peoples from the northern
Peloponnese. These Bronze Age people, whose earlier origins remain
unknown, anticipated many of the great advances of the Ancient
Greeks. They spoke a proto-Greek language and came into the Pelo-
ponnese around 3000 BC, overthrowing the preexisting Neolithic
culture and establishing a more sophisticated culture evident in their
expert metalwork and architecture. The citadel at Mycenae, home to
the legendary Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and conqueror of Troy,
as well as the smaller citadel at Tiryns, where Hercules is reputed to
have been born, form the core of what remains of this culture. Unlike
the Minoans, the Mycenaean peoples earned a reputation as fierce
warriors, given that their territory was centrally located along a ma-
jor migratory route and was therefore more vulnerable to outside in-
vaders. The citadel at Mycenae, begun around 1350 BC, was built
atop a hill and reflects this need for protection, with its huge stone
ring walls and an entry that restricts the visitor to a narrow path
through the famous Lion Gate of Mycenae, and then into the walled
compound. 
The Lion Gate, dated around 1250 BC, is built with megalithic
stones that rise up in a post-and-lintel system and are then capped
with a keystone, an inverted triangular stone that helps direct the
weight of the heavy materials as well as the weight of gravity down
through the posts rather than over the center of the weaker lintel. This
feature reflects a more sophisticated structural system than previ-
ously employed in architecture. Although the use of the keystone
here is conflated with the more traditional post-and-lintel system,
which is formed with a slight arch to relieve more of the weight, it set
the stage for later structural developments found in Ancient Rome.
Two lions are carved into the keystone and flank a column, resting
their front legs on its base. The use of guardian lions flanking palace
entrances was widespread in Ancient Near Eastern architecture,
while the elaborate burial rituals seen in Mycenaean tombs attest to
Ancient Egyptian influences. Inside the citadel, beehive tombs,
formed in a conical shape, housed hammered gold face masks,</a>

It was built as a place to protect and control the city of London.The tower of London was first built in the 11th century within the Roman city walls. The Roman military architecture was built by William the Conqueror, and has expanded over history. The complex consists of several buildings including the White Tower, and is surrounded by defensive walls and a moat.      The Tower is an important landmark in England, UK, which known for several features. Perhaps the most famous of these features is that the Tower of London houses the Crown Jewels in its Jewel House. The Crown Jewels includes many symbols of royalty, including a collection of crowns, scepters, swords, and rings. These historical items are kept well-guarded in the tower, after their theft (and later recovery) from Westminster Abbeyin 1303. During its initial years, this grand palace also served as a royal residence. The palace is guarded by the Queen's Guards, notable for their distinctive uniform with a red coat and tall black hat.The tower is one of the UK's finest castles and as one of the strongest fortresses in the land. It is the crown jewels. Tower of London also houses a fine collection of Armor and many other displays showing nine centuries of British history. Its purpose was to protect and control the city.

                                            the past, there was a king in South Sulawesi who had seven daughters. That said, if you have 7 children, one of them must be offered to the Giant Eagle so that the palace family is protected from disaster.
This made the king satisfied and decided to open a contest. Anyone who succeeds in conquering Rajawali, if he is a man, will be married to one of his daughters. If he is a woman, he will be appointed as a family member.
Therefore, many residents flocked to save the royal princess. However, no one managed to defeat Rajawali.
When the Giant Eagle was installed and released by the princess, there came a young man who saved him with a rope and badik. He also managed to stab and kill Rajawali. The princess finally survived and was able to return to the kingdom with relief and calm.
Unfortunately, the young man then left and did not come to ask for his salary. Therefore, the king was returned to find the conqueror of the Rajawali.
Therefore, there are many people who claim to have saved the princess. Agreeing, the princess still saved the face of the man who had saved her.
"Father! That's the young man who defeated the giant eagle! Exclaimed the Princess while pointing towards the young man in the middle of the race arena."
The King gasped in surprise, as if he did not believe what he was witnessing. Apparently, in addition to magic, young people are also very adept at playing soccer. The King was very impressed by the young man. After the young man came out of the race arena, the King departed the young man.
The king asked, "why did you not come to the kingdom, to collect the promise of your success in saving my child?" The boy replied, "I saved the princess not because of her gift, but the servant was sincere. Even if the king wants to marry us, I want everything based on the request of the princess. "
The princess also said if she had been liked by the man since the beginning of meeting. In the end, they live together and are happy forever.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:yang tersohor dengan sebutan William Sang Penakluk dan julukan William Si Haram Jadah,[2][b] adalah Raja Inggris pertama dari bangsa Norman. William menjadi Raja Inggris sejak tahun 1066 sampai mangkat pada tahun 1087. Ia masih terhitung keturunan Rollo, dan menyandang jabatan Adipati Normandia sejak tahun 1035. Melalui perjuangan panjang, William berhasil menegakkan kedaulatannya atas Normandia pada tahun 1060. Enam tahun kemudian, ia memimpin bangsa Norman menggempur dan menaklukkan Inggris. Sampai akhir hayatnya, William terus-menerus berjuang menegakkan kedaulatannya atas Inggris dan menanggulangi masalah-masalah yang ditimbulkan putra sulungnya, Robert Courteheuse.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>William terlahir sebagai anak haram, putra Robert Sang Dikara, Adipati Normandia, dari gundiknya yang bernama Herleva. Status selaku anak haram maupun usia yang masih sangat muda menjadi sumber masalah saat William resmi menyandang jabatan Adipati Normandia sepeninggal ayahnya, demikian pula anarki yang merongrong tahun-tahun pertama masa pemerintahannya. Para menak Norman saling memerangi sejak William masih kanak-kanak sampai akil balig, baik demi mendapatkan hak asuh atas dirinya, maupun demi kepentingan pribadi masing-masing. William berhasil memadamkan pemberontakan pada tahun 1047, dan mulai berjuang menegakkan kedaulatannya atas Kadipaten Normandia sampai tahun 1060. Perkawinannya dengan Mathilde, anak perempuan Bupati Flandria, pada era 1050-an menjadi penggalang dukungan dari Flandria bagi perjuangannya. Sampai dengan hari perkawinannya, William sudah berhasil menempatkan para pendukungnya pada jabatan-jabatan uskup dan abas di Normandia. Perjuangan menegakkan kedaulatan atas Normandia merangsang William untuk terus memperluas wawasan dan pengalaman tempurnya. Pada tahun 1062, ia merebut Kabupaten Maine, jiran Kadipaten Normandia.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Pada era 1050-an dan awal era 1060-an, nama William mencuat sebagai salah seorang calon Raja Inggris, karena Raja Inggris yang bertahana ketika itu adalah Edward Sang Pengaku Iman, saudara sepupu ayahnya yang tidak kunjung dikaruniai keturunan. Calon ahli waris lainnya adalah Harold Putra Godwin, Earl Inggris yang ditunjuk menjadi raja pengganti oleh Edward Sang Pengaku Iman sebelum tutup usia pada bulan Januari 1066. Dengan alasan bahwa Edward Sang Pengaku Iman sudah berjanji mewariskan takhta kepadanya, dan bahwa Harold Putra Godwin sudah bersumpah mendukungnya menjadi ahli waris takhta, William menyiapkan satu armada besar dan menginvasi Inggris pada bulan September 1066. Ia mengalahkan dan menewaskan Harold dalam pertempuran Hastings pada tanggal 14 Oktober 1066. Sesudah susah payah berjuang, William akhirnya dinobatkan menjadi Raja Inggris pada hari Natal tahun 1066 di London. Ia masih sempat membenahi urusan pemerintahan Inggris sebelum pulang ke Normandia pada awal tahun 1067. Meskipun beberapa kali dirongrong pemberontakan, kedaulatan William atas Inggris akhirnya dapat ditegakkan sepenuhnya pada tahun 1075, sehingga ia dapat lebih sering bermastautin di daratan Eropa.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Pada tahun-tahun menjelang akhir hayatnya, William direpotkan berbagai masalah yang mengganggu ketenteraman negeri-negeri kekuasaannya di daratan Eropa, masalah-masalah yang ditimbulkan putranya, Robert Courtehose, maupun ancaman invasi orang Dani atas Inggris. Pada tahun 1086, William memerintahkan penyusunan Kitab Domesday, daftar seluruh tanah pertuanan feodal di Inggris berikut nama tuan tanahnya sebelum invasi bangsa Norman maupun nama tuan tanah yang ada pada saat penyusunan daftar. Ia mangkat pada bulan September 1087, selagi memimpin kampanye militer di kawasan utara Prancis. Jenazahnya dikuburkan di Caen. Masa pemerintahannya di Inggris ditandai pembangunan puri-puri, pengukuhan para petinggi Norman menjadi kaum menak baru di negeri itu, dan kemunculan muka-muka baru di jajaran rohaniwan Inggris. Alih-alih mempersatukan negeri-negeri kekuasaannya menjadi sebuah kekaisaran, William justru menyelenggarakan pemerintahan tiap-tiap negeri secara terpisah. Sesudah ia mangkat, wilayah kedaulatannya dipecah. Takhta Kadipaten Normandia diwarisi Robert Courtehose, sementara takhta Kerajaan Inggris diwarisi William Rufus.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:SELAMATBEKERJA!</strong></p><p></p><br />

He wrote a book about his travels thatbecame one of the most famous travel guides in history. They called him "the man with amillion stories." Marco Polo was born in 1254 to a family of merchants. His home was Venice,Italy. Venetian merchants bought and sold valuable Chinese goods, including precious silk cloth.Such goods were brought to Europe along an ancient route known as the Silk Road. The merchantsalso used the route to travel east on trading missions. His family taught him to be a merchant. Helearned how to read, write, calculate, and use foreign money.In 1271. Marco's father and uncle, Niccolo and Maffeo set out for China again. Marco, then17 years old, joined his father and uncle for the trip. It took the Polos four difficult years to reachChina. The journey led across deserts and high mountains. They passed through wild countrysidewhere bandits lurked, ready to rob and kill. They braved heat and cold, floods, deep snowdrifts.and blinding sandstorms. At last they reached the summer palace of the Mongol conqueror. KublaiKhan, at Shangdu,The Khan welcomed the Polos warmly. He offered Marco a job. Marco accepted, and thePolos lived in China for the next 17 years. Marco travelled on many special missions across theKhan's kingdom and to distant lands. When Marco returned from his missions, he told the Khanvivid stories about the people and lands he visited. Over time, the Polos worried that Kublai Khanwould not allow them to leave. Several times they had asked the Khan for permission to returnto Europe. But the khan enjoyed his story so much that he would not grant their wish. Finally, theKhan changed his mind. In 1292. Kublai Khan asked Marco to escort a Mongol princess to Persia.The Polos travelled by ship from China to the Persian Gulf. Then the Polos headed for Venice,finally reaching home in 1295.In 1298, he became a prisoner of war. He shared his cell with a writer named Rustichello, whohelped Marco turned his stories into a book. Marco Polo returned to Venice after his release fromprison. He died in 1324. But his book remained popular for centuries. Merchants, mapmakers, andexplorers all looked to the book for information about Asian lands.

Napoleon Bonaparte Emperor of the French, 1769 - 1821 Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769 in Ajaccio on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, the son of Carlo and Letizia Bonaparte. Through his military exploits and his ruthless efficiency, Napoleon rose from obscurity to become Napoleon I, Empereur des Francais (Emperor of the French). He is both a historical figure and a legend—and it is sometimes difficult to separate the two. The events of his life fired the imaginations of great writers, film makers, and playwrights whose works have done much to create the Napoleonic legend. Napoleon decided on a military career when he was a child, winning a scholarship to a French military academy at age 14. His meteoric rise shocked not only France but all of Europe, and his military conquests threatened the stability of the world. Napoleon was one of the greatest military commanders in history. He has also been portrayed as a power hungry conqueror. Napoleon denied those accusations. He argued that he was building a federation of free peoples in a Europe united under a liberal government. But if this was his goal, he intended to achieve it by taking power in his own hands. However, in the states he created, Napoleon granted constitutions, introduced law codes, abolished feudalism, and created efficient governments and fostered education, science, literature and the arts. Emperor Napoleon proved to be an excellent civil administrator. One of his greatest achievements was his supervision of the revision and collection of French law into codes. The new law codes—seven in number—incorporated some of the freedoms gained by the people of France during the French revolution, including religious toleration and the abolition of serfdom. The most famous of the codes, the Code Napoleon or Code Civil, still forms the basis of French civil law. Napoleon also centralized France's government by appointing prefects to administer regions called departments, into which France was divided. While Napoleon believed in government "for" the people, he rejected government "by" the people. His France was a police state with a vast network of secret police and spies. The police shut down plays containing any hint of disagreement or criticism of the government. The press was controlled by the state. It was impossible to express an opinion without Napoleon's approval.</h2><br />

                            6. tugas bahasa InggrisRead the following text loudly and answer the questions!Tower of LondonThe Tower of London is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078, and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. Early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat, a canal that goes around it. The White Tower's purpose was two-fold. It was used for protection: guarding the king and the queen as well as valuables and holding prisoners. It was also used for national security, especially from intimidating London's citizens.The White Tower is large. Most other buildings in London would have been only one story high. The White Tower is around 90 feet high, and would have been visible for miles. It is also strong. It would have been difficult to attach. The walls are up to 15 feet thick. Its only windows were small and low down and the main door was at the top of a wooden staircase. It is built of stone. Almost all London's houses were built of wood. Some of the stone came by ship from Normandy. It was difficult to build. William I and his son forced the Anglo-Saxons from several counties as well as London to work on the building of the White Tower.Questions:1. Where is the Tower of London located?answer:2.

Ultimately, this Minoan culture did not survive; it was usurped in
regional importance by the Mycenaean peoples from the northern
Peloponnese. These Bronze Age people, whose earlier origins remain
unknown, anticipated many of the great advances of the Ancient
Greeks. They spoke a proto-Greek language and came into the Pelo-
ponnese around 3000 BC, overthrowing the preexisting Neolithic
culture and establishing a more sophisticated culture evident in their
expert metalwork and architecture. The citadel at Mycenae, home to
the legendary Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and conqueror of Troy,
as well as the smaller citadel at Tiryns, where Hercules is reputed to
have been born, form the core of what remains of this culture. Unlike
the Minoans, the Mycenaean peoples earned a reputation as fierce
warriors, given that their territory was centrally located along a ma-
jor migratory route and was therefore more vulnerable to outside in-
vaders. The citadel at Mycenae, begun around 1350 BC, was built
atop a hill and reflects this need for protection, with its huge stone
ring walls and an entry that restricts the visitor to a narrow path
through the famous Lion Gate of Mycenae, and then into the walled
compound. 
The Lion Gate, dated around 1250 BC, is built with megalithic
stones that rise up in a post-and-lintel system and are then capped
with a keystone, an inverted triangular stone that helps direct the
weight of the heavy materials as well as the weight of gravity down
through the posts rather than over the center of the weaker lintel. This
feature reflects a more sophisticated structural system than previ-
ously employed in architecture. Although the use of the keystone
here is conflated with the more traditional post-and-lintel system,
which is formed with a slight arch to relieve more of the weight, it set
the stage for later structural developments found in Ancient Rome.
Two lions are carved into the keystone and flank a column, resting
their front legs on its base. The use of guardian lions flanking palace
entrances was widespread in Ancient Near Eastern architecture,
while the elaborate burial rituals seen in Mycenaean tombs attest to
Ancient Egyptian influences. Inside the citadel, beehive tombs,
formed in a conical shape, housed hammered gold face masks,</h2><br />

I looked at the man and the young women angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned around again. ‘I can’t hear a word!’ I said angrily.

Napoleon Bonaparte Emperor of the French, 1769 - 1821 Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769 in Ajaccio on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, the son of Carlo and Letizia Bonaparte. Through his military exploits and his ruthless efficiency, Napoleon rose from obscurity to become Napoleon I, Empereur des Francais (Emperor of the French). He is both a historical figure and a legend—and it is sometimes difficult to separate the two. The events of his life fired the imaginations of great writers, film makers, and playwrights whose works have done much to create the Napoleonic legend. Napoleon decided on a military career when he was a child, winning a scholarship to a French military academy at age 14. His meteoric rise shocked not only France but all of Europe, and his military conquests threatened the stability of the world. Napoleon was one of the greatest military commanders in history. He has also been portrayed as a power hungry conqueror. Napoleon denied those accusations. He argued that he was building a federation of free peoples in a Europe united under a liberal government. But if this was his goal, he intended to achieve it by taking power in his own hands. However, in the states he created, Napoleon granted constitutions, introduced law codes, abolished feudalism, and created efficient governments and fostered education, science, literature and the arts. Emperor Napoleon proved to be an excellent civil administrator. One of his greatest achievements was his supervision of the revision and collection of French law into codes. The new law codes—seven in number—incorporated some of the freedoms gained by the people of France during the French revolution, including religious toleration and the abolition of serfdom. The most famous of the codes, the Code Napoleon or Code Civil, still forms the basis of French civil law. Napoleon also centralized France's government by appointing prefects to administer regions called departments, into which France was divided. While Napoleon believed in government "for" the people, he rejected government "by" the people. His France was a police state with a vast network of secret police and spies. The police shut down plays containing any hint of disagreement or criticism of the government. The press was controlled by the state. It was impossible to express an opinion without Napoleon's approval.</h2><br />
                        Percakapan Pribadi Minggu lalu saya pergi ke teater. Saya memiliki tempat duduk yang sangat bagus. Drama itu sangat menarik. Saya tidak menikmatinya. Seorang pemuda dan seorang wanita muda duduk di belakangku. Mereka berbicara keras. Saya sangat marah Aku tidak bisa mendengar para aktor. Aku berbalik. Aku menatap pria dan wanita muda itu dengan marah. Mereka tidak memperhatikannya. Pada akhirnya, saya tidak tahan lagi. Aku berbalik lagi. "Aku tidak bisa mendengar sepatah kata pun!" Kataku dengan marah. Bukan urusanmu, "kata pemuda itu kasar. 'Ini adalah percakapan pribadi!' (Sumber: Alexander, L.G. 1975. Praktek &amp; Kemajuan Yogyakarta: PenerbitKanisius, hal 13) II. Carilahjenis-jenisphrasedalamteks di bawahinidanjelaskan. (minimal 5). Kaisar Napoleon Bonaparte dari Prancis, 1769 - 1821 Napoleon Bonaparte lahir pada tanggal 15 Agustus 1769 di Ajaccio di pulau Mediterania Corsica, putra Carlo dan Letizia Bonaparte. Melalui eksploitasi militer dan efisiensi kejamnya, Napoleon bangkit dari ketidakjelasan menjadi Napoleon I, Empereur des Francais (Kaisar Prancis). Dia adalah tokoh sejarah dan legenda-dan terkadang sulit memisahkan keduanya. Peristiwa hidupnya memecat imajinasi para penulis, pembuat film, dan dramawan hebat yang karya-karyanya telah banyak dilakukan untuk menciptakan legenda Napoleon. Napoleon memutuskan untuk menjalani karir militer saat ia masih kecil, memenangkan beasiswa ke akademi militer Prancis pada usia 14 tahun. Kemarahannya yang meroket mengejutkan tidak hanya Prancis tapi juga di seluruh Eropa, dan penuntutan militernya mengancam stabilitas dunia. Napoleon adalah salah satu komandan militer terbesar dalam sejarah. Dia juga telah digambarkan sebagai penakluk yang haus kekuasaan. Napoleon membantah tuduhan tersebut. Dia berpendapat bahwa dia sedang membangun sebuah federasi masyarakat bebas di Eropa yang bersatu di bawah pemerintahan liberal. Tapi jika ini adalah tujuannya, dia bermaksud mencapainya dengan mengambil alih kekuasaan di tangannya sendiri. Namun, di negara bagian yang ia ciptakan, Napoleon memberikan konstitusi, memperkenalkan peraturan hukum, menghapus feodalisme, dan menciptakan pemerintahan yang efisien dan mendorong pendidikan, sains, sastra dan seni. Kaisar Napoleon terbukti menjadi administrator sipil yang hebat. Salah satu prestasi terbesarnya adalah pengawasan revisi dan pengumpulan hukum Perancis menjadi kode. Kode undang-undang yang baru - tujuh nomor - menggabungkan beberapa kebebasan yang diperoleh orang-orang Prancis selama revolusi Prancis, termasuk toleransi beragama dan penghapusan perhambaan. Kode yang paling terkenal, Kode Napoleon atau Kode Sipil, masih menjadi dasar hukum perdata Prancis. Napoleon juga memusatkan pemerintah Prancis dengan menunjuk prefek untuk mengelola daerah-daerah yang disebut departemen, di mana Prancis terbagi. Sementara Napoleon percaya pada pemerintah "untuk" rakyat, dia menolak pemerintah "oleh" rakyat. Prancis-nya adalah sebuah negara kepolisian dengan jaringan polisi rahasia dan mata-mata yang luas. Polisi menutup permainan yang berisi sedikit ketidaksepakatan atau kritik terhadap pemerintah. Pers dikendalikan oleh negara. Tidak mungkin mengungkapkan pendapat tanpa persetujuan Napoleon.<br />Maaf kalo salah <br />
