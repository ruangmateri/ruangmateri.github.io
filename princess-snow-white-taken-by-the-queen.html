He told her to run far away so the Queen would never find her.Snow White ran deep into the woods. She was lost and scared but soon found herself in front of a cottage.The princess knocked, but no one was home. She slowly stepped inside.The cottage was a mess! With the help of her forest friends, Snow White cleaned every nook and cranny."Maybe whoever lives here will let me stay," said Snow White.Upstairs, Snow White found seven little beds. She thought they belonged to children.Tired from cleaning, Snow White yawned as she curled up on the beds and fell asleep.Meanwhile, the Seven Dwarfs were heading home from a long day of working in a jewel mine.

Her plan was to trick the princess.After the Dwarfs had set off for work the next day, the Queen, disguised as an old peddler woman, offered Snow White a beautiful red apple.Snow White took one bite of the apple and fell into a deep sleep. The Queen had poisoned her!When the Dwarfs came home, they chased the Queen to the top of a stormy mountain. Suddenly, lightning hit the mountain, and the Queen fell, never to be seen again.But Snow White was still in a deep sleep.

                                            Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess named Snow White. She was kind and gentle and a friend to all animals.One day, Snow White met a charming prince. As they sang a song of love together, Snow White's evil stepmother, the Queen, watched them.The Queen was so jealous of Snow White's beauty that she ordered her Huntsman to kill the young princess.But the Huntsman couldn't bring himself to hurt Snow White. He told her to run far away so the Queen would never find her.Snow White ran deep into the woods. She was lost and scared but soon found herself in front of a cottage.The princess knocked, but no one was home. She slowly stepped inside.The cottage was a mess! With the help of her forest friends, Snow White cleaned every nook and cranny."Maybe whoever lives here will let me stay," said Snow White.Upstairs, Snow White found seven little beds. She thought they belonged to children.Tired from cleaning, Snow White yawned as she curled up on the beds and fell asleep.Meanwhile, the Seven Dwarfs were heading home from a long day of working in a jewel mine. They were anxious to get home to their cottage in the woods.The Seven Dwarfs were surprised when they found a princess inside their home!When Snow White awoke, she was charmed by the Seven Dwarfs: Dopey, Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, and Sleepy.The Dwarfs wanted to protect the beautiful princess from the evil queen, so they invited Snow White to live with them.To celebrate, the new friends sang and danced the night away.Back at the castle, the Queen learned that Snow White was still alive.Enraged, she made a magic potion to change her appearance. Her plan was to trick the princess.After the Dwarfs had set off for work the next day, the Queen, disguised as an old peddler woman, offered Snow White a beautiful red apple.Snow White took one bite of the apple and fell into a deep sleep. The Queen had poisoned her!When the Dwarfs came home, they chased the Queen to the top of a stormy mountain. Suddenly, lightning hit the mountain, and the Queen fell, never to be seen again.But Snow White was still in a deep sleep. The Seven Dwarfs kept watch over her day and night.Finally, Snow White's Prince Charming arrived. He had been searching everywhere for the beautiful princess he had sung with so long ago.The Prince awakened Snow White with Love's First Kiss. The spell was broken! Snow White and the Prince returned to the kingdom and lived happily ever after.Tolong diisi Generic structure seperti orientation, complication, resolution, re.orientation, evaluation </a>

                        jawabannya..<br />A poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red. She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called Snow White and the other Rose Red, and they were the sweetest and best children in the world: always hard working and cheerful. But Snow White was quieter and more gentle than Rose Red. Rose Red loved to run about the fields and meadows, and to pick flowers and catch butterflies. Snow White sat at home with her mother and helped her in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no work to do.<br /><br />The two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand in hand, and when Snow White said, “We will never desert each other,” Rose Red answered, “No, not as long as we live,” and the mother added, “Whatever one gets she shall share with the other.” They often roamed about in the woods gathering berries and no beast threatened to hurt them. In fact, animals loved and trusted the two girls. The little hare would eat a cabbage leaf from their hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past them merrily, and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might.<br /><br />No evil ever befell them; if they stayed late in the wood and night overtook them, they lay down together on the moss and slept until morning, and their mother knew they were quite safe, and never felt anxious about them. Once, when they had slept all night in the wood and had been wakened by the morning sun, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white robe sitting close to their resting place. The figure got up, looked at them kindly, but said nothing, and vanished into the wood. When they looked around them they realised that they had slept quite close to a deep crater in the ground. If they had gone a few steps further in the darkness, they would have fallen into it. When they told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had seen must have been the angel that guards good children.<br /><br />Snow White and Rose Red kept their mother’s cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it. In summer Rose Red looked after the house, and every morning before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed, from each tree a rose. In winter Snow White lit the fire and put on the kettle, which was made of brass, but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold. In the evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said, “Snow White, go and close the shutters,” and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat and spun. Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb, and behind them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings.<br /><br />One evening as they sat cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he wanted to come in. The mother said, “Rose Red, open the door quickly; it must be some traveller seeking shelter.” Rose Red hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside - but it was no such thing - only a bear, who poked his thick black head through the door. Rose Red screamed aloud and sprang back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its wings, and Snow White ran and hid behind her mother’s bed. The bear began to speak, and said, “Don’t be afraid. I won’t hurt you. I am half frozen, and only wish to warm myself a little.”<br /><br />“My poor bear,” said the mother, “lie down by the fire, only take care you don’t burn your fur.” Then she called out, “Snow White and Rose Red, come out; the bear will do you no harm - he is a good, honest creature.”<br /><br />So they both came out of their hiding places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too, and they all forgot their fear. The bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him until he was dry. Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and growled quite happily and comfortably. The children soon grew quite at their ease with him, and teased him and played with him quite roughly. <br /><br />semoga membantu ya...<br />
