Dear Tiara
I’m so glad knowing that you will come here next holiday. It’s been almost two years we haven’t met each other since our graduation. I miss you so much.
Any way, we have a new park. It is a beautiful place to hang out with friends and family. If you come here, I will take you there.
You said you would go by train. However, I don’t know when you will come here exactly. Please tell me the time, so I can pick you up at the railway station.
O.K, that’s all for you now. Please reply soon. Send my love to your parents.
Love
Donita

And spoke to them, and told them things, and showed them all her love.but because she was just one small girls, her garden Fairly little. she found her flowers rather cramped and squished up in the middle. and so, she knew see should have to choose what plants to grow in there. which one she would love the most, untill they thrived beneath her care.She took a bucket, laid it out and spread seeds on the grass. She ordered them from first to plant, all the way to last. happiness and truth and love. the seeds had funny names. And honest, and kindness, and sadness, fear, and blame. "if I plant sadness here", she thought. "There's no room for this love". "And if I water kindness, it will let light from above".she Made her choice though it was hard: should see water Joy or fear? especially when see knew that life was planted very near. but finally, she did it all. her garden was created. she took A look, and breathed it in. her whole self was elated.because we can plant every plant: we have to choose the ones that we will plant and flower and share wide, with everyone.Comprehension question worksheet1. what is the story about?2. how many characters there in the story? mention them!3. where and when did the story happen?4. who is the main character of the story? what happened to the main character?5. what was the writer purpose of writing the story?Mohon bantuannya​</a>

All Of Me
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Apa yang harus kulakukan tanpa mulut bawel?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Mengaturku, kau mencampakanku
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
Kau membuat kepalaku berputar, tanpa candaan, ku takbisa mengecewakanmu
What's going on in that beautiful mind
Apa yang terjadi pada pemikiran indahitu
I'm on your magical mystery ride
Aku dalam perjalanan misteri ajaibmu
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Dan aku sangat pusing, tak tahu apa yang menimpaku, namun aku kan baik saja
My head's under water
Kepalaku didalam air
But I'm breathing fine
Namunaku bisa bernafas
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
Kau gila dan aku kehilangan akal
'Cause all of me
Karena semua diriku
Loves all of you
Mencintai semua yang ada pada dirimu
Love your curves and all your edges
Mencintai lekuk tubuhmu dan semua sisimu
All your perfect imperfections
Semua ketidaksempurnaan sempurnamu
Give your all to me
Berikan semuanya padaku
I'll give my all to you
Kan keberikan semua milikku padamu
You're my end and my beginning
Kau awal dan akhirku
Even when I lose I'm winning
Bahkan saat aku kalah, akumenang
'Cause I give you all of me
Karena kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semuanya padaku
How many times do I have to tell you
Berapa kali kuharus mengatakan padamu
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
Bahkan saat kau menangis kau tetap cantik
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
Dunia mengecewakanmu, aku melewati semua suasana hati
You're my downfall, you're my muse
Kau air terjunku, kau inspirasiku
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
Gangguan terburukku, iramaku, dan blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
Ku tak bisa berhenti bernyanyi, nadanya, di kepalaku untukmu
Give me all of you
Berikan semua padaku
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Karu di meja, kita berdua menunjukkan hati (AS)
Risking it all, though it's hard
Mempertaruhkan semua, meskipun sulit
I give you all of me
Kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semua padaku, ohoh

                                            Dear All,At last, we are at the end of our academic year. I know the last few months haven’t been easy at all. We have been forced to do lots of activities so much different from what we did previously.Remember the time when the situation made us stay in instead of going out. We have experienced about “social distancing” as a strategy to fight COVID-19 as well as to protect ourselves. Also, we have been cancelling meeting appointments, hanging out activities, and even planned trips. I believe things have been tough for all of us.Now, you are facing final exams, you have been studying independently, you have been convincing yourselves that you could study from home, manage your time, try to understand lessons and do your assignments physically away from fellow students and teachers . So far, you survive. You are incredible!My wish for you is that you see the light in this world, in yourself, and in others. I see the light in you. Compliment others, and be proud of your own accomplishments. I am proud of you. Believe in yourself, for you are stronger than you know. I believe in you. Try hard, but know your limits. Ask if you need help, and trust others will help you. I will help you. Fill your heart with laughter and smile often. I love to see your smile. You are a unique, special, and amazing person. There will never be another you. I appreciate all of you.Dream, believe, wonder, inspire, love, nurture, and always listen. That is what I will do for you.Love,Your Biggest Supporter​</a>

Now... cry out!
I'm watching closely... this world full of lies.
I'm picturing... the darkness known as love.
Even if I end up losing my heart,
I'll at least protect you until the end!
Tomorrow, this cruel hatred
Will reach out its hand,
Trying to keep us under its rule...
A storm of grief we must overcome...
A true nature we don't want to accept...
That's all too painful, too scary — please don't pay it mind!
(Please take the magic)
If these scars will never seal up, then even through the pain
I'll steal away your tears!
(I want to be strong for you)
Destroy every one of those pre-determined limitations,
Right now!
I'm looking up... at those dreams that didn't come true.
I'm seeking... something as unreliable as these bonds.
Even if I have to sacrifice this life,
I'll attain happiness, no matter what!
Eventually, this merciless sorrow
Will proceed to cover up
The future we're heading for...
An insurmountable vortex of anger
And a cherished desire that can never be embraced...
I hate it, it's too unfair — please don't show me!
(Please take the magic)
I don't care if I become a monster in the end,
'Cause then I could devour your despair!
(I don't want to hurt you)
Release the impulse being raised inside of you
And... cry out!
If a day without regrets will someday come,
Rather than simply praying, let's raise our voices — right now!
Cry out... this grief!
Cry out... this pain!
Cry out... this anger!
Cry out... "I'm right here!"
Let's embrace and keep on living, even if it's all a lie.
I'll believe... and choose you as my dream!
A storm of grief we must overcome...
A true ambition we hope to someday have forgiven...
That's all too painful, too scary — please don't pay it mind!
(I don't need magic)
If these scars will never seal up, then even through the pain
I'll steal away your tears!
(I want to be strong for you)
Destroy every one of those pre-determined limitations,
Right now!</a>

Lirik
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

                                            the story tells us about?Once upon a time, in an island there lived all the feelings and emotions : Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day it was announced to them that the island would sink! So all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.  Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.  When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.  Richness was passing by Love in a boat. Love said,  "Richness, can you take me with you?" Richness answered, "Sorry Love, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat and so there is no place here for you."  Love next asked Vanity who was also sailing by. Vanity was also ready with the same answer.   "I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered.  Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, take me along with you." "Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!", sadness said in a sullen voice.  Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so preoccupied with her happiness that she did not even hear when Love called her.   Suddenly, there was a voice, "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. An overjoyed Love jumped up into the boat and in the process forgot to ask where they were going. When they arrived at a dry land, the elder went her own way.   Realizing how much was owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge another elder, "Who Helped me?" "It was Time," Knowledge answered. "Time?" thought Love. Then, as if reading the face of Love, Knowledge smiled and answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is." </a>

Lirik
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

All Of Me
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Apa yang harus kulakukan tanpa mulut bawel?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Mengaturku, kau mencampakanku
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
Kau membuat kepalaku berputar, tanpa candaan, ku takbisa mengecewakanmu
What's going on in that beautiful mind
Apa yang terjadi pada pemikiran indahitu
I'm on your magical mystery ride
Aku dalam perjalanan misteri ajaibmu
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Dan aku sangat pusing, tak tahu apa yang menimpaku, namun aku kan baik saja
My head's under water
Kepalaku didalam air
But I'm breathing fine
Namunaku bisa bernafas
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
Kau gila dan aku kehilangan akal
'Cause all of me
Karena semua diriku
Loves all of you
Mencintai semua yang ada pada dirimu
Love your curves and all your edges
Mencintai lekuk tubuhmu dan semua sisimu
All your perfect imperfections
Semua ketidaksempurnaan sempurnamu
Give your all to me
Berikan semuanya padaku
I'll give my all to you
Kan keberikan semua milikku padamu
You're my end and my beginning
Kau awal dan akhirku
Even when I lose I'm winning
Bahkan saat aku kalah, akumenang
'Cause I give you all of me
Karena kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semuanya padaku
How many times do I have to tell you
Berapa kali kuharus mengatakan padamu
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
Bahkan saat kau menangis kau tetap cantik
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
Dunia mengecewakanmu, aku melewati semua suasana hati
You're my downfall, you're my muse
Kau air terjunku, kau inspirasiku
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
Gangguan terburukku, iramaku, dan blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
Ku tak bisa berhenti bernyanyi, nadanya, di kepalaku untukmu
Give me all of you
Berikan semua padaku
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Karu di meja, kita berdua menunjukkan hati (AS)
Risking it all, though it's hard
Mempertaruhkan semua, meskipun sulit
I give you all of me
Kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semua padaku, ohoh

                                            I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone
Man, F that sh--
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone</a>

If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.
And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.
If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you.
And when the world was through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
Then you and I would simply fly away</a>

                                            If our love was a fairy tale
I would charge in and rescue you
On a yacht baby we would sail
To an island where we'd say I do
And if we had babies they would look like you
It'd be so beautiful if that came true
You don't even know how very special you are
[Chorus]
You leave me breathless
You're everything good in my life
You leave me breathless
I still can't believe that you're mine
You just walked out of one of my dreams
So beautiful you're leaving me
Breathless
And if our love was a story book
We would meet on the very first page
The last chapter would be about
How I'm thankful for the life we've made
And if we had babies they would have your eyes
I would fall deeper watching you give life
You don't even know how very special you are
[Chorus]
You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me
You're like an angel
The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me
You're something special
I only hope that I'll one day deserve what you've given me
But all I can do is try
Every day of my life

If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.
And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.
If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you.
And when the world was through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
Then you and I would simply fly away</a>

All Of Me
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Apa yang harus kulakukan tanpa mulut bawel?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Mengaturku, kau mencampakanku
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
Kau membuat kepalaku berputar, tanpa candaan, ku takbisa mengecewakanmu
What's going on in that beautiful mind
Apa yang terjadi pada pemikiran indahitu
I'm on your magical mystery ride
Aku dalam perjalanan misteri ajaibmu
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Dan aku sangat pusing, tak tahu apa yang menimpaku, namun aku kan baik saja
My head's under water
Kepalaku didalam air
But I'm breathing fine
Namunaku bisa bernafas
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
Kau gila dan aku kehilangan akal
'Cause all of me
Karena semua diriku
Loves all of you
Mencintai semua yang ada pada dirimu
Love your curves and all your edges
Mencintai lekuk tubuhmu dan semua sisimu
All your perfect imperfections
Semua ketidaksempurnaan sempurnamu
Give your all to me
Berikan semuanya padaku
I'll give my all to you
Kan keberikan semua milikku padamu
You're my end and my beginning
Kau awal dan akhirku
Even when I lose I'm winning
Bahkan saat aku kalah, akumenang
'Cause I give you all of me
Karena kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semuanya padaku
How many times do I have to tell you
Berapa kali kuharus mengatakan padamu
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
Bahkan saat kau menangis kau tetap cantik
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
Dunia mengecewakanmu, aku melewati semua suasana hati
You're my downfall, you're my muse
Kau air terjunku, kau inspirasiku
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
Gangguan terburukku, iramaku, dan blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
Ku tak bisa berhenti bernyanyi, nadanya, di kepalaku untukmu
Give me all of you
Berikan semua padaku
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Karu di meja, kita berdua menunjukkan hati (AS)
Risking it all, though it's hard
Mempertaruhkan semua, meskipun sulit
I give you all of me
Kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semua padaku, ohoh

                            14. Dear All,At last, we are at the end of our academic year. I know the last few months haven’t been easy at all. We have been forced to do lots of activities so much different from what we did previously.Remember the time when the situation made us stay in instead of going out. We have experienced about “social distancing” as a strategy to fight COVID-19 as well as to protect ourselves. Also, we have been cancelling meeting appointments, hanging out activities, and even planned trips. I believe things have been tough for all of us.Now, you are facing final exams, you have been studying independently, you have been convincing yourselves that you could study from home, manage your time, try to understand lessons and do your assignments physically away from fellow students and teachers . So far, you survive. You are incredible!My wish for you is that you see the light in this world, in yourself, and in others. I see the light in you. Compliment others, and be proud of your own accomplishments. I am proud of you. Believe in yourself, for you are stronger than you know. I believe in you. Try hard, but know your limits. Ask if you need help, and trust others will help you. I will help you. Fill your heart with laughter and smile often. I love to see your smile. You are a unique, special, and amazing person. There will never be another you. I appreciate all of you.Dream, believe, wonder, inspire, love, nurture, and always listen. That is what I will do for you.Love,Your Biggest Supporter​</h2><br />

Now... cry out!
I'm watching closely... this world full of lies.
I'm picturing... the darkness known as love.
Even if I end up losing my heart,
I'll at least protect you until the end!
Tomorrow, this cruel hatred
Will reach out its hand,
Trying to keep us under its rule...
A storm of grief we must overcome...
A true nature we don't want to accept...
That's all too painful, too scary — please don't pay it mind!
(Please take the magic)
If these scars will never seal up, then even through the pain
I'll steal away your tears!
(I want to be strong for you)
Destroy every one of those pre-determined limitations,
Right now!
I'm looking up... at those dreams that didn't come true.
I'm seeking... something as unreliable as these bonds.
Even if I have to sacrifice this life,
I'll attain happiness, no matter what!
Eventually, this merciless sorrow
Will proceed to cover up
The future we're heading for...
An insurmountable vortex of anger
And a cherished desire that can never be embraced...
I hate it, it's too unfair — please don't show me!
(Please take the magic)
I don't care if I become a monster in the end,
'Cause then I could devour your despair!
(I don't want to hurt you)
Release the impulse being raised inside of you
And... cry out!
If a day without regrets will someday come,
Rather than simply praying, let's raise our voices — right now!
Cry out... this grief!
Cry out... this pain!
Cry out... this anger!
Cry out... "I'm right here!"
Let's embrace and keep on living, even if it's all a lie.
I'll believe... and choose you as my dream!
A storm of grief we must overcome...
A true ambition we hope to someday have forgiven...
That's all too painful, too scary — please don't pay it mind!
(I don't need magic)
If these scars will never seal up, then even through the pain
I'll steal away your tears!
(I want to be strong for you)
Destroy every one of those pre-determined limitations,
Right now!</h2><br />

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, " Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, " Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, " Please don't go, " and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, " Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, " Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

                            19. the story tells us about?Once upon a time, in an island there lived all the feelings and emotions : Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day it was announced to them that the island would sink! So all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.  Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.  When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.  Richness was passing by Love in a boat. Love said,  "Richness, can you take me with you?" Richness answered, "Sorry Love, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat and so there is no place here for you."  Love next asked Vanity who was also sailing by. Vanity was also ready with the same answer.   "I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered.  Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, take me along with you." "Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!", sadness said in a sullen voice.  Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so preoccupied with her happiness that she did not even hear when Love called her.   Suddenly, there was a voice, "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. An overjoyed Love jumped up into the boat and in the process forgot to ask where they were going. When they arrived at a dry land, the elder went her own way.   Realizing how much was owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge another elder, "Who Helped me?" "It was Time," Knowledge answered. "Time?" thought Love. Then, as if reading the face of Love, Knowledge smiled and answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is." </h2><br />

                            23. 1. Read the following lyric and then answer the questions!
All Of Me
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Apa yang harus kulakukan tanpa mulut bawel?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Mengaturku, kau mencampakanku
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
Kau membuat kepalaku berputar, tanpa candaan, ku takbisa mengecewakanmu
What's going on in that beautiful mind
Apa yang terjadi pada pemikiran indahitu
I'm on your magical mystery ride
Aku dalam perjalanan misteri ajaibmu
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Dan aku sangat pusing, tak tahu apa yang menimpaku, namun aku kan baik saja
My head's under water
Kepalaku didalam air
But I'm breathing fine
Namunaku bisa bernafas
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
Kau gila dan aku kehilangan akal
'Cause all of me
Karena semua diriku
Loves all of you
Mencintai semua yang ada pada dirimu
Love your curves and all your edges
Mencintai lekuk tubuhmu dan semua sisimu
All your perfect imperfections
Semua ketidaksempurnaan sempurnamu
Give your all to me
Berikan semuanya padaku
I'll give my all to you
Kan keberikan semua milikku padamu
You're my end and my beginning
Kau awal dan akhirku
Even when I lose I'm winning
Bahkan saat aku kalah, akumenang
'Cause I give you all of me
Karena kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semuanya padaku
How many times do I have to tell you
Berapa kali kuharus mengatakan padamu
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
Bahkan saat kau menangis kau tetap cantik
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
Dunia mengecewakanmu, aku melewati semua suasana hati
You're my downfall, you're my muse
Kau air terjunku, kau inspirasiku
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
Gangguan terburukku, iramaku, dan blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
Ku tak bisa berhenti bernyanyi, nadanya, di kepalaku untukmu
Give me all of you
Berikan semua padaku
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Karu di meja, kita berdua menunjukkan hati (AS)
Risking it all, though it's hard
Mempertaruhkan semua, meskipun sulit
I give you all of me
Kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semua padaku, ohoh

                            25. I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone
Man, F that sh--
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone</h2><br />

If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.
And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.
If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you.
And when the world was through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
Then you and I would simply fly away</h2><br />

                            29. If our love was a fairy tale
I would charge in and rescue you
On a yacht baby we would sail
To an island where we'd say I do
And if we had babies they would look like you
It'd be so beautiful if that came true
You don't even know how very special you are
[Chorus]
You leave me breathless
You're everything good in my life
You leave me breathless
I still can't believe that you're mine
You just walked out of one of my dreams
So beautiful you're leaving me
Breathless
And if our love was a story book
We would meet on the very first page
The last chapter would be about
How I'm thankful for the life we've made
And if we had babies they would have your eyes
I would fall deeper watching you give life
You don't even know how very special you are
[Chorus]
You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me
You're like an angel
The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me
You're something special
I only hope that I'll one day deserve what you've given me
But all I can do is try
Every day of my life

If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.
And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.
If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you.
And when the world was through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
Then you and I would simply fly away</h2><br />
