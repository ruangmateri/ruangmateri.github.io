                                            There’s a certain sinking feeling one gets when thinking of the perfect thing to say just a moment too late. There is no English word to express this feeling, but the French have the term l’esprit de l’escalier for this very phenomenon. The English language also lacks the word to describe the binge eating that follows an emotional blow, but the Germans have kummerspeck to do just that. If we had the Swedish word lagom, the English explanation of Goldilocks’ perfectly temperate soup __40__a lot more accurate. 
__41__English speakers are limited in their choice of words surprises many non-native English speakers. There are many words that English speakers don’t have. Sometimes Anglophones take from other languages, but often, we have to find a way around a specific feeling or emotion that doesn’t have its own word. The reason why we borrow words like savoir faire from French is because that word did not culturally evolve as part of our language. Speaking different languages means you get different frames and metaphors. You’re also learning the culture of the language so you get not only different words, but also different types of words. 
However, the benefits of speaking multiple languages extend past just having access to different words, concepts, metaphors, and frames. Multilingualism has __43__. Multilinguals tend to score better on standardized tests, especially in math, reading, and vocabulary. They are better at remembering lists or sequences due to intensive learning of grammatical rules and vocabulary. They are more perceptive to their surroundings and therefore better at focusing on important information while __44__misleading information

Sometimes Anglophones take from other languages, but often, we have to find a way around a specific feeling or emotion that doesn’t have its own word. The reason why we borrow words like savoir faire from French is because that word did not culturally evolve as part of our language. Speaking different languages means you get different frames and metaphors. You’re also learning the culture of the language so you get not only different words, but also different types of words. 
The phrase "find a way around" in the  paragraph means....
(A) avoid the main topic
(B) look in the wrong place
(C) ask what someone is thinking
(D) be very familiar with an activity
(E) discover how to deal with something</a>

                                            Sekolah Menengah Atas  B. inggris  5+3 poinRead the following text! Find the meaning of the bolded words Then answer the questions!Proverbs exist in every language and culture and are a way of passing down folk wisdom, or “ common sense “, from generation to generation. Who doesn’t remember a time when they were struggling with a problem or dilemma, and someone quoted a proverb that aptly summed up or explained the situation? “ All’s fair in love and war “, describe the injustice that is often encountered in romantic relationship and may help some of us accept it. “ Absence makes the heart grow fonder “, its meant to give hope when a loved one is far away. When that same relationship is brought to an end by distance, we hear, “ Out sight, out of mind “.Proverbs have lasted for thousands of years, probably because they’re so memorable. Some are short and concise, like “ Practice makes perfect “ and “ Haste makes waste “, while others use a poetic language such as metaphors, repetition, and rhymes. The metaphors “ Out of the frying pan and into the fire “ is easy to visualize when you are faced with a difficult situation that just got even worse. The repetition of consonant “ t “ makes it easy to remember “ It takes two to tango “. The rhyme “ When the cat’s away, the mice will play “, comes to mind as soon as possible as the boss leaves on vacation, and the repetition of the structure in “ Once bitten, twice shy “, makes this an extremely catchy phrase.Some scholars who study proverb look for example that are unique to a particular culture as a key to understanding cultural differences. Others focus on the proverbs that appears in almost every language as away of defining a common wisdom that bids all humans together,Proverbs don’t always offer up universal truth, however, and they are frequently contradictory. People say , “ Clothes make the man “, to reflect the importance of appearance as part of one’s personal identity. On the other hand, they also say, “ You can judge a book by its cover “, to point out that appearances can be deceptive. And with “ Handsome is a handsome does”, they stress the value of good behavior over good looks.So while proverb can help us grasp some universally shared wisdom, they also force us to recognize that life is complex and there are no easy answer. The complexity of the human condition as reflected in proverb is yet another thing that is shared by people around the world.QUESTIONS1.According to the text, what are proverbs?2.Why have proverbs lasted for thousands of years ?3.Some proverbs use a poetic language such metaphor, repetition, and rhyme. What are they?4.What can we learn from learning proverbs?5.Mention some proverbs found in the text and their meaning!​</a>

                                            Weather Related Problem
Every year thousands of people die, due to weather related problems. It can happen in both winter and in summer. Let’s examine the causes for a moment.
The year 2003 was a time of extreme cold in the winter. Extreme, that is by European standards. In Britain alone, the number of people who died from cold-related illnesses was described as ‘shameful’. Nearly twenty-five thousand people died from illnesses such as strokes, heart attacks, bronchitis, flu and pneumonia.
In the summer of t he same year, around twenty-three thousand people died in Europe due to the sizzling temperatures. France was particulary badly hit, with nearly fifteen thousand death which were related to the sweltering heat. In Britain, the number of heat-related death was much lower than the number of winter deaths.
It is important to note that government need to give some advices to people on how to protect their health.

                                            Metaphor is for most people a device of the poetic imagination and the rhetorical flourish –a matter of extraordinary rather than ordinary language. Moreover, metaphorical is typically viewed as characteristic of language alone, a matter of words rather than thought or action. For this reason, most people think they can get along perfectly well without metaphor. We have found, on the contrary, that metaphor is perpasive in everyday life, not just in language but in thought and action. Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentaly metaphorical in nature.The concepts that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern our everyday functioning, down to mundane details. Our concepts structure what we perceive, how we get around in the world, and how we relate to other people. Our conceptual system thus plays a central role in defining our everyday realities. If we are right in suggesting that our conceptual system is largely metaphorical, then the way we think, what we experience, and what we do everyday is very much a matter of metaphor.But our conceptual system is not something we are normally aware of. In most of the little things we do everyday, we simply think and act more or less automatically along certain lines. Just what these lines are by no means obvious. One way to find out is by looking at language. Since communication is based on the same conceptual system that we use in thinking and acting, language is an important source of evidence for what the system like. Primarily on the basis of linguistic evidence, we have found that most of our ordinary conceptual system is metaphorical in nature. Shortly, to give some idea of what it could mean for a concept to be metaphorical and for such concept to structure an everyday activity, let us see the concept ARGUMENT IS WAR. This metaphor is reflected in our everyday language by a wide variety expressions, such as; Your claims are indefensible, He attacked every weakpoint in my argument, His criticisms were right on target, I’ve never won an argument with him, You disagree, okay, shoot!, and the like.(Source: Metaphors We Live by, George Lakoff &amp; Mark Johnson, 2003: 11)Find the meaning of the following words or phrase based on the above text!1. metaphor:..........................................................................................................2. conceptual system:........................................................................................3. mundane:..........................................................................................​</a>

                                            1. The Legend of the Kesodo Ceremony            Once upon a time on Mount Bromo, East Java, there were a couple living there. The new couple wanted to have a child. They had married for a long time but they hadn’t got a baby. Every time they prayed to the Gods, asking for a child. One day, there was a loud voice in the sky when they were praying. “You are going to born a baby, and later you will birth many children. But I have a requirement for you to obey, if you really want to have children”, said the voice. “Whatever you ask, my Lord”, the couple answered, “We will do it”, “You must sacrifice your first son for the gods”.        The couple agreed to sacrifice their first son in the time that was asked by the voice. Then, the wife got pregnant and gave birth to a son. The baby grew up into a handsome, taught man. He was named Kesuma. The couple loved Kesuma very much. The wife gave birth to eleven more children after Kesuma. And, they forget their promise to sacrifice their first son to the god.        One day, the volcano erupted. Before that, there were series of earthquakes followed by thunders in the sky. The sky was very dark, as if it was going to fall down. On the next occasion, there was a voice in the sky, reminding the couple about their promise. The couple was very afraid, but they just couldn’t sacrifice their beloved son, Kesuma. However, because the earthquakes and the thunders were becoming more and more horrifying, Kesuma couldn’t let his family and all the people in the village die.        Kesuma knew the situation. Then he said to his parents. “I would sacrifice myself in order that our family and all the people in our village will live in peace. For the next times, you all have to sacrifice animals and crops to the gods.” Then he jumped onto the crater of the volcano. Amazingly, the earthquakes and the eruption stopped at once. How was Kesuma’s personal characteristic?A. MelancholicB. FearfulC. HeroicD. ShamefulE. Tragic​</a>

                                            You can see that the underlined words in the sentences above are compared to each other. The words as and like are bolded to show that a simile occurs in this sentence. Like a simile, a metaphor compares words in a sentence; however, instead of saying that one thing is like something else, a metaphor actually makes one thing become something very different by renaming it. A metaphor can sometimes use words like is, are, or was (and other words) to signal that a metaphor is present. However, a metaphor never uses the words like or as to compare. You can see in these examples that the first underlined word is actually renamed by the second underlined word. The bolded words are bolded to show that the second underlined word is something else. 1. A. Below are sentences that contain similes and metaphors. Underline the two words in each sentence that are being compared. 1. The cat's fur was a blanket of warmth. 2. The lamp was a beacon of sunshine. 3. The fireworks were a lantern in the sky. 4. John slept like a log. 5. Mary was as sweet as pie. 6. George is lightning as he runs the race. 7. Gwen sings like an expert. 8. Mark's voice is velvet. 9. Cindy is a fish when she swims. 10. Tom is like a computer when he does his math. 2. The smoke was cotton balls billowing from the chimney. You are my hero. The sun was a furnace. B. Write on the lines below whether each sentence above is a simile or a metaphor. Write S for simile or M for metaphor. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

"Why walk when you have an ass to ride?" called out the husband, "seat the boy on the ass."
"I would like that," said the boy, "help me up father. And the father did that willingly. 
Soon they met another couple. "How shameful of you!" cried the woman, "let your father ride, won't he be tired?"
So, the boy got down and the father rode the ass. Again they marched on."poor boy", said the next person they met, "why should the lazy father ride while his son is walking?
"So, the boy got onto the ass too. As they went on, they met some travelers 
"How cruel of them!" They are up to kill the poor ass." cried one of the travellers.
Hearing this, the father and the son got down. Now they decided to carry the ass on their shoulders. As they did so, the travellers broke into laughter.
The laughter frightened the ass. It broke free and galloped away.

In Britain alone, the number of people who died from cold-related illnesses was described as ‘shameful’. Nearly twenty-five thousand people died from illnesses such as strokes, heart attacks, bronchitis, flu and pneumonia. In the summer of t he same year, around twenty-three thousand people died in Europe due to the sizzling temperatures. France was particulary badly hit, with nearly fifteen thousand death which were related to the sweltering heat. In Britain, the number of heat-related death was much lower than the number of winter deaths.

                                            corect the error!!
Hi, my name is Ferbian Valensia, I was born in Jakarta. When I was in elementary school, I was a private person, I often cried in the toilet, I also found it very difficult to get along with many friends, even I preferred to play with male friends at that time. At that time when I was walking in the school corridor when it was raining heavily, I thought to be careful not to slip, but at that time my eyes were drawn to see the tree that swayed when the rain fell and it looked a little funny to me. Without realizing it, my gaze that did not pay attention to the road made me fall in the corridor. I spontaneously shouted and the teacher came running out to me and many students saw me at that time. Not a few of them laugh at me. I am very embarrassed, I who have been careful when walking, have to fall like that. And when I try to get up and stand up Sadly I have to fall again because the floor and my pedestal are not good. I was ashamed to be the center of attention at that time but what else, it's also my fault who was negligent in walking. If only I had kept my gaze in the right direction I definitely wouldn't have happened like this. Even on the next day I was embarrassed to go to school, in my mind I was sure that if I entered school I would definitely be laughing at people if I saw me fall yesterday. I wanted not to go to school at that time and thought of just being at home, but I thought, I can't run away from my problems especially because I fell yesterday I had to not go to school and leave my lessons. Indeed, this is a shameful experience for me and I will make it a lesson for me.</a>

Find the metaphors and similes in the lyric. What do they mean?
(John Lennon-Imagine)
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one</a>

Every year thousands of people die, due to weather related problems. It can happen in both winter and in summer. Let’s examine the causes for a moment.
The year 2003 was a time of extreme cold in the winter. Extreme, that is by European standards. In Britain alone, the number of people who died from cold-related illnesses was described as ‘shameful’. Nearly twenty-five thousand people died from illnesses such as strokes, heart attacks, bronchitis, flu and pneumonia.
In the summer of t he same year, around twenty-three thousand people died in Europe due to the sizzling temperatures.

                            5. There’s a certain sinking feeling one gets when thinking of the perfect thing to say just a moment too late. There is no English word to express this feeling, but the French have the term l’esprit de l’escalier for this very phenomenon. The English language also lacks the word to describe the binge eating that follows an emotional blow, but the Germans have kummerspeck to do just that. If we had the Swedish word lagom, the English explanation of Goldilocks’ perfectly temperate soup __40__a lot more accurate. 
__41__English speakers are limited in their choice of words surprises many non-native English speakers. There are many words that English speakers don’t have. Sometimes Anglophones take from other languages, but often, we have to find a way around a specific feeling or emotion that doesn’t have its own word. The reason why we borrow words like savoir faire from French is because that word did not culturally evolve as part of our language. Speaking different languages means you get different frames and metaphors. You’re also learning the culture of the language so you get not only different words, but also different types of words.

                            12. Sekolah Menengah Atas  B. inggris  5+3 poinRead the following text! Find the meaning of the bolded words Then answer the questions!Proverbs exist in every language and culture and are a way of passing down folk wisdom, or “ common sense “, from generation to generation. Who doesn’t remember a time when they were struggling with a problem or dilemma, and someone quoted a proverb that aptly summed up or explained the situation? “ All’s fair in love and war “, describe the injustice that is often encountered in romantic relationship and may help some of us accept it. “ Absence makes the heart grow fonder “, its meant to give hope when a loved one is far away. When that same relationship is brought to an end by distance, we hear, “ Out sight, out of mind “.Proverbs have lasted for thousands of years, probably because they’re so memorable. Some are short and concise, like “ Practice makes perfect “ and “ Haste makes waste “, while others use a poetic language such as metaphors, repetition, and rhymes. The metaphors “ Out of the frying pan and into the fire “ is easy to visualize when you are faced with a difficult situation that just got even worse. The repetition of consonant “ t “ makes it easy to remember “ It takes two to tango “. The rhyme “ When the cat’s away, the mice will play “, comes to mind as soon as possible as the boss leaves on vacation, and the repetition of the structure in “ Once bitten, twice shy “, makes this an extremely catchy phrase.Some scholars who study proverb look for example that are unique to a particular culture as a key to understanding cultural differences. Others focus on the proverbs that appears in almost every language as away of defining a common wisdom that bids all humans together,Proverbs don’t always offer up universal truth, however, and they are frequently contradictory. People say , “ Clothes make the man “, to reflect the importance of appearance as part of one’s personal identity. On the other hand, they also say, “ You can judge a book by its cover “, to point out that appearances can be deceptive. And with “ Handsome is a handsome does”, they stress the value of good behavior over good looks.So while proverb can help us grasp some universally shared wisdom, they also force us to recognize that life is complex and there are no easy answer. The complexity of the human condition as reflected in proverb is yet another thing that is shared by people around the world.QUESTIONS1.According to the text, what are proverbs?2.Why have proverbs lasted for thousands of years ?3.Some proverbs use a poetic language such metaphor, repetition, and rhyme.

                            14. Weather Related Problem
Every year thousands of people die, due to weather related problems. It can happen in both winter and in summer. Let’s examine the causes for a moment.
The year 2003 was a time of extreme cold in the winter. Extreme, that is by European standards. In Britain alone, the number of people who died from cold-related illnesses was described as ‘shameful’. Nearly twenty-five thousand people died from illnesses such as strokes, heart attacks, bronchitis, flu and pneumonia.
In the summer of t he same year, around twenty-three thousand people died in Europe due to the sizzling temperatures. France was particulary badly hit, with nearly fifteen thousand death which were related to the sweltering heat. In Britain, the number of heat-related death was much lower than the number of winter deaths.
It is important to note that government need to give some advices to people on how to protect their health.

                            16. Metaphor is for most people a device of the poetic imagination and the rhetorical flourish –a matter of extraordinary rather than ordinary language. Moreover, metaphorical is typically viewed as characteristic of language alone, a matter of words rather than thought or action. For this reason, most people think they can get along perfectly well without metaphor. We have found, on the contrary, that metaphor is perpasive in everyday life, not just in language but in thought and action. Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentaly metaphorical in nature.The concepts that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern our everyday functioning, down to mundane details. Our concepts structure what we perceive, how we get around in the world, and how we relate to other people. Our conceptual system thus plays a central role in defining our everyday realities. If we are right in suggesting that our conceptual system is largely metaphorical, then the way we think, what we experience, and what we do everyday is very much a matter of metaphor.But our conceptual system is not something we are normally aware of. In most of the little things we do everyday, we simply think and act more or less automatically along certain lines. Just what these lines are by no means obvious. One way to find out is by looking at language. Since communication is based on the same conceptual system that we use in thinking and acting, language is an important source of evidence for what the system like. Primarily on the basis of linguistic evidence, we have found that most of our ordinary conceptual system is metaphorical in nature. Shortly, to give some idea of what it could mean for a concept to be metaphorical and for such concept to structure an everyday activity, let us see the concept ARGUMENT IS WAR. This metaphor is reflected in our everyday language by a wide variety expressions, such as; Your claims are indefensible, He attacked every weakpoint in my argument, His criticisms were right on target, I’ve never won an argument with him, You disagree, okay, shoot!, and the like.(Source: Metaphors We Live by, George Lakoff &amp; Mark Johnson, 2003: 11)Find the meaning of the following words or phrase based on the above text!1. metaphor:..........................................................................................................2. conceptual system:........................................................................................3. mundane:..........................................................................................​</h2><br />

                            18. 1. The Legend of the Kesodo Ceremony            Once upon a time on Mount Bromo, East Java, there were a couple living there. The new couple wanted to have a child. They had married for a long time but they hadn’t got a baby. Every time they prayed to the Gods, asking for a child. One day, there was a loud voice in the sky when they were praying. “You are going to born a baby, and later you will birth many children. But I have a requirement for you to obey, if you really want to have children”, said the voice. “Whatever you ask, my Lord”, the couple answered, “We will do it”, “You must sacrifice your first son for the gods”.        The couple agreed to sacrifice their first son in the time that was asked by the voice. Then, the wife got pregnant and gave birth to a son. The baby grew up into a handsome, taught man. He was named Kesuma. The couple loved Kesuma very much. The wife gave birth to eleven more children after Kesuma. And, they forget their promise to sacrifice their first son to the god.        One day, the volcano erupted. Before that, there were series of earthquakes followed by thunders in the sky. The sky was very dark, as if it was going to fall down. On the next occasion, there was a voice in the sky, reminding the couple about their promise. The couple was very afraid, but they just couldn’t sacrifice their beloved son, Kesuma. However, because the earthquakes and the thunders were becoming more and more horrifying, Kesuma couldn’t let his family and all the people in the village die.        Kesuma knew the situation. Then he said to his parents. “I would sacrifice myself in order that our family and all the people in our village will live in peace. For the next times, you all have to sacrifice animals and crops to the gods.” Then he jumped onto the crater of the volcano. Amazingly, the earthquakes and the eruption stopped at once. How was Kesuma’s personal characteristic?A. MelancholicB. FearfulC. HeroicD. ShamefulE. Tragic​</h2><br />

                            20. You can see that the underlined words in the sentences above are compared to each other. The words as and like are bolded to show that a simile occurs in this sentence. Like a simile, a metaphor compares words in a sentence; however, instead of saying that one thing is like something else, a metaphor actually makes one thing become something very different by renaming it. A metaphor can sometimes use words like is, are, or was (and other words) to signal that a metaphor is present. However, a metaphor never uses the words like or as to compare. You can see in these examples that the first underlined word is actually renamed by the second underlined word. The bolded words are bolded to show that the second underlined word is something else. 1. A. Below are sentences that contain similes and metaphors. Underline the two words in each sentence that are being compared. 1. The cat's fur was a blanket of warmth. 2. The lamp was a beacon of sunshine. 3. The fireworks were a lantern in the sky. 4. John slept like a log. 5. Mary was as sweet as pie. 6. George is lightning as he runs the race. 7. Gwen sings like an expert. 8. Mark's voice is velvet. 9. Cindy is a fish when she swims. 10. Tom is like a computer when he does his math. 2. The smoke was cotton balls billowing from the chimney. You are my hero. The sun was a furnace. B. Write on the lines below whether each sentence above is a simile or a metaphor. Write S for simile or M for metaphor. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

"Why walk when you have an ass to ride?" called out the husband, "seat the boy on the ass."
"I would like that," said the boy, "help me up father. And the father did that willingly. 
Soon they met another couple. "How shameful of you!" cried the woman, "let your father ride, won't he be tired?"
So, the boy got down and the father rode the ass. Again they marched on."poor boy", said the next person they met, "why should the lazy father ride while his son is walking?
"So, the boy got onto the ass too. As they went on, they met some travelers 
"How cruel of them!" They are up to kill the poor ass." cried one of the travellers.
Hearing this, the father and the son got down. Now they decided to carry the ass on their shoulders. As they did so, the travellers broke into laughter.
The laughter frightened the ass. It broke free and galloped away.

"kenapa kamu berjalan saat kamu memiliki kuda untuk ditunggangi?" kata si suami. "dudukanlah anakmu diatas kuda""aku juga ingin" kata anak laki-laki itu. "tolong naikkan aku ke atas, ayah!" dan ayahnya membantunya. tak lama, mereka bertemu pasangan lainnya. "seharusnya kamu malu!" kata sang istri sambil menangis. "kamu membiarkan ayahmu berjalan. dia akan kecapaian". jadi, anak laki-laki itu turun dan ayahnya menunggangi kudanya. kemudian, mereka bertemu dengan pasangan lainnya. "kasihan anak laki-laki itu", "kenapa ayah yang malas itu hanya duduk di atas kuda saat anaknya berjalan?" dan ayah serta anak laki-lakinya pun duduk bersama diatas kuda. saat mereka tengah berjalan, mereka bertemu sekelompok turis. "betapa kejamnya mereka! mereka dapat membunuh kuda itu!" salah satu dari turis itu menangis. mendengar hal itu, sang ayah dan anak laki-lakinya pun turun dan berjalan. sekarang, mereka memutuskan untuk menuntun kuda mereka. saat para turis melihat mereka menuntun kuda itu, para turis itu pun tertawa. tawaan para turis itu membuat takut sang kuda. dan akhirnya kuda itu lari dan kabur. Suatu hari, seorang pria sedang pergi ke pasar dengan anaknya dan seekor keledainya. mereka bertemu pasangan di jalan.<br />"Kenapa berjalan padahal kamu memiliki keledai yang bisa ditunggangi?" teriak si suami, " berilah duduk anak itu di atas keledai."<br />"saya mau," kata anak itu, "bantu aku ayah''. Dan sang ayah melakukan itu dengan sukarela.<br />Tak lama kemudian mereka bertemu pasangan lain. "memalukan!" teriak wanita itu, "biarkan ayahmu naik, tidakkah ia lelah?"<br />Maka, si anak itupun turun dan sang ayah menaiki si keledai. Sekali lagi mereka bergegas jalan. "Anak yang malang", kata orang berikutnya yang mereka temui, "mengapa harus si ayah pemalas ini yang menunggangi sementara anaknya berjalan?"<br />Maka, si anak itupun naik ke atas keledai juga. Ketika mereka pergi, mereka bertemu dengan beberapa wisatawan"Betapa kejamnya mereka!" Mereka bisa saja membunuh si keledai yang malang itu. "Teriak salah satu wisatawan.<br />Mendengar hal ini, sang ayah dan si anak pun turun. Sekarang mereka memutuskan untuk membawa keledai di pundak mereka. Ketika mereka melakukannya, para wisatawan tertawa terbahak-bahak.<br />Gelak tawa yang memecah itu membuat si keledai ketakutan. Ia pun melepaskan diri dan berlari kencang menjauh. <br />

                            33. corect the error!!
Hi, my name is Ferbian Valensia, I was born in Jakarta. When I was in elementary school, I was a private person, I often cried in the toilet, I also found it very difficult to get along with many friends, even I preferred to play with male friends at that time. At that time when I was walking in the school corridor when it was raining heavily, I thought to be careful not to slip, but at that time my eyes were drawn to see the tree that swayed when the rain fell and it looked a little funny to me. Without realizing it, my gaze that did not pay attention to the road made me fall in the corridor. I spontaneously shouted and the teacher came running out to me and many students saw me at that time. Not a few of them laugh at me. I am very embarrassed, I who have been careful when walking, have to fall like that. And when I try to get up and stand up Sadly I have to fall again because the floor and my pedestal are not good. I was ashamed to be the center of attention at that time but what else, it's also my fault who was negligent in walking. If only I had kept my gaze in the right direction I definitely wouldn't have happened like this. Even on the next day I was embarrassed to go to school, in my mind I was sure that if I entered school I would definitely be laughing at people if I saw me fall yesterday. I wanted not to go to school at that time and thought of just being at home, but I thought, I can't run away from my problems especially because I fell yesterday I had to not go to school and leave my lessons. Indeed, this is a shameful experience for me and I will make it a lesson for me.</h2><br />

Find the metaphors and similes in the lyric. What do they mean?
(John Lennon-Imagine)
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one</h2><br />
